*(a.k.a. The Bulwark, The Crying God, The One Who Endures, The Thousand-Lashed, The Forgiven Martyr)*

>A heavy-browed, thick-limbed proto-elf stumbles through the forest, clutching helplessly at her chest, trying desperately to pull the pain out. She made the wrong choice, ate the wrong berry, and now she suffers. The berry's toxins run rampant through her nervous system, and soon she is paralyzed. In her mind, her blood is filed with boiling oil and her skin is torn from her flesh. She hopes that a wolf will arrive to tear out her throat. She tries to beg for death, but her species hasn't yet learned the words. It doesn't matter. In that moment, Vaad is born. He steps forth from unreality and firmly grasps the elf's throat. She dies staring into into the eyes of a crying God, and is finally granted relief. 
>
>Vaad is the God of mercy, fortitude, and determination. He is the ultimate aspiration of defenders of the weak, the patron lord of armoursmiths, and the inevitable final companion of all sufferers.
### Worship by the Solassian Concordat

#### The upper classes
Vaad is a prime [[God|deity]] in [[Solassian Concordat|Solassian]] worship and a member of the Divine Triumvirate, a trio of Gods said to espouse qualities that all Solassians should aspire to. To the powerful, Vaad represents resilience against threats from without. Kings, knights, and prophets petition Vaad for guidance when their worldly stations are threatened, and send him thanks when they survive unlikely odds. The powerful offer only token acknowledgement of Vaad's merciful aspects, preferring to rule through violence and oppression. Occasionally, they ask Vaad to grant their victims mercy in the afterlife.

In truth, Vaad bears a seething hatred for the ruling class of the Solassian Concordat. It is only his mercy that has protected them from the full extent of his wrath for this long.
#### The lower classes
The worship of Vaad waxes and wanes with the level of suffering inflicted upon the Solassian Concordat's underclass. From under the heel of the ruling class, the average peasant wishes for little more than reprieve, and Vaad grants it. Occasionally, he offers more than merely the cessation of pain, and grants the downtrodden sufferer the means to save themselves or those they love. Â  

In times of extraordinary oppression, Vaad glows brightly, and can take no more. He whispers in the ears of the underclass and begs them to throw off their chains, and when they do, he empowers them to fight until the bitter end. It is said that Vaad was responsible for the rebellion that led to the signing of the Solassian Concordat itself, and that his disappointment with the status quo that arose since has led him to be far more careful with his influence.
