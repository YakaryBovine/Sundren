The [[Material Plane]] is one side of a coin, and the [[Ethereal Plane]] is on the other face. The Ethereal is a dimension of raw power and malleability. It is mutable and structureless; its geography and physical makeup are determined at the whim of its native inhabitants. These inhabitants are Spirits, immaterial forces of pure energy that dance around the Ethereal, forming the plane in front of them and deconstructing it behind them as they flit from indeterminate place to indeterminate place. Spirits are ordinarily incapable of permanence; their forms are obliterated and reconstituted at every moment, they retain no memories of the past, and they have no concept of the future. To a Spirit, there is only the present, and the present is an unknown quantity, to be created, experienced, and abandoned in a single moment. 

It is precisely the ever-shifting nature of the Ethereal Plane that renders the structural rigidity of the Material Plane so addictive to Spirits. Whenever a curious Spirit peers into the Material Plane and gets a taste of permanence, it is forever changed. It becomes persistently drawn to the notions of decision making, robust physical laws, and sequential time, and it craves influence over the strange world that offers those things. These Spirits become Awakened, and there is nothing more satisfying to an Awakened Spirit than to observe effect following cause, except to observe effect following the Spirit's own actions.

The first Material Plane discovery that a Spirit makes determines its form, personality, powers, and the way in which it seeks to further influence the world. Spirits that discover specific natural entities such as a cliffside or a particular river become [[Elemental]]s, while those that discover intrinsically mortal concepts such as death or justice become [[God]]s. Other types of Spirits include [[Fiend]]s, [[Fey]], [[Celestial]]s and [[Primal]]s.

Spirits can be destroyed. For an Unawakened Spirit, death is as inconsequential as any other possible event, for the event will effectively never have happened as of the next moment. But for an Awakened Spirit, death is a catastrophic event that obliterates everything about it. The Spirit's memories, physical form, and ability to sustain permanence are lost. It reverts back to an Unawakened Spirit, forgetting it ever knew of anything else.
