When a [[Spirit]]'s first discovery in the [[Material Plane]] is an intrinsically mortal concept such as death or justice, that Spirit becomes utterly enamored with that concept. It forms its entire personality around it and makes it its eternal mission to maintain the strength and consistency of that concept. These Spirits also become extremely attached to mortals, particularly those who identify with or revere the chosen concept, and they attempt to build deep connections with them. These connections vary slightly in nature, but are typically ones of worship, in which the mortal pays token service to the Spirit and receives protection and powerful boons in exchange. Thus, from the mortal perspective, these Spirits are Gods.   

Gods have by far the most mortal-like personalities of all the Spirits, and when they present themselves in visions or voices they tend to take on mortal-like forms. Gods are incapable of entering the Material Plane. Instead, they influence it through the exertion of reality-bending powers that can only manifest in places that are either dedicated to their worship or saturated heavily enough by their chosen concept. Their primary tool of influence is through their [[Clerics]]: dedicated and wise agents upon whom the Gods bestow portions of their power in the form of divine Magic. Although concept maintenance is always a God's first priority, their strength and personal satisfaction is also dependent on reverence. With each new follower, a God gains another set of eyes through which to observe reality, a new set of hands through which to exert their influence, and a new mind to marvel over.   

Due to their inability to enter the Material Plane, Gods seek to emulate the experience of living in a robust world by creating one of their own. Using their reality-bending powers, they declare ownership over a region of the Ethereal Plane and malleate it according to their whim, creating a region of enforced existence that reflects both aspects of the Material Plane and of the God's discovered concept. This region becomes the God's Divine Plane. In response to the fear of the unknown many mortals have for the final destination of their soul, many Gods offer their Divine Plane as a final resting place. If the deal is accepted, the God plucks the mortal's soul from their body in the moments before death, and brings it to the Ethereal Plane to experience eternity.
