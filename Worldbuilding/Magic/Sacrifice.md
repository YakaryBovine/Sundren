The prosperity of the [[Solassian Concordat]] was built on the blood, sweat, and tears of the devout. Its citizens were possessed of a willing loyalty to their creators and to the divine purpose set out by the Covenant, and they would voluntarily dedicate their own lives to the cause - in whatever form that took. For some, that fierce dedication meant lives of zealous labour in service to the state, while for others it meant the scholarly pursuit of theological knowledge in the divine places of the world, and for others yet it meant the demystifying of arcane knowledge in prestigious universities and dusty libraries. 

When the Great War started, the citizens of the Concordat had their loyalty tested to their breaking points when it became clear that in order to defeat the [[Stålråd]], the Empire would need to harness far more magical power than it could possibly muster through existing means. Extraordinarily powerful rituals were devised that were capable of levelling mountains, drying out oceans, shattering landscapes and resurrecting entire battlefields of the fallen. In order to power them, the Empire asked their citizens to surrender their very lives. They did so in droves, spilling litters of their own blood into the mystic runes that would serve to protect the Empire and ensure that the Covenant could still be fulfilled.
