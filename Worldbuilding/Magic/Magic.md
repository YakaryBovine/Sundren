Magic is the ability to arbitrarily bend material reality through action. There are two forms of Magic, each diametrically opposed to each other but capable of coexisting; the Arcane, and the Spiritual.
### Arcane
The [[Material Plane]] is held together by a purple-blue crystalline lattice network known as the [[Leyline|Leylines]]. This structure constitutes and enforces reality, in a manner that binds its inhabitants - mortals and travelling Spirits alike - to certain physical laws.

The crystalline structure can be subtly manipulated through intricate patterns of tone, movement, and energy, the summation of which are known as spells. These spells cause precise, calculated ripples in the Leylines, in turn affecting reality in predictable ways. [[Wizard|Wizards]] are those rare individual who have dedicated their lives to the study of this Arcane magic, and are the sole wielders of its power.

As Arcane magic both originates from and affects the material world, it has the capacity to be permanent, taking the form of enchantments, workings, curses, and rituals, which can only be removed through further acts of the Arcane or the destruction of the subject.
### Spiritual
The [[Ethereal Plane]] wraps around the [[Material Plane|Material]] like a blanket, affording the [[Spirit]] inhabitants there the ability to manipulate it through imagination and willpower. Unawakened Spirits lack both of these attributes and are unable to exercise their abilities, and can only gain them through transformative insights into the Material. Once awakened, all Spirits gain a measure of power dependent on their form.

Mortals can gain access to spiritual magic through these awakened Spirits. For instance, [[Cleric|Clerics]] can gain power from [[God|Gods]] through theological practice, [[Warlock|Warlocks]] from [[Fiend|Fiends]] through pacts and sacrifices, and [[Druid|Druids]] from [[Primal|Primals]] through the defense of nature.

Much like Spirits themselves, Spiritual magic is fleeting and immaterial. Even the most powerful blessing will dissipate with the death of the God sustaining it.
