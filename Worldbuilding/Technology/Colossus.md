Some minds were deemed to be of such strategic to the value to the [[Stålråd]] that it become necessary to outright remove the possibility of their premature demise. Host Colossi were enormous, towering that were built to be both unstoppable and unkillable, and they housed the minds of only the most revered and intelligent techno lords. They were made exclusively from refined adamantine, carried personalized super-weapons designed to eliminate city sized populations, and contained within them six redundant artificial brain copies. 

Very few Host Colossi fell to enemy forces throughout the Great War. As the conflict raged, however, the repeated atrocities committed by the Colossi took an immense toll on their psyches, worsened by the mental strain of maintaining several redundant minds. Driven nearly to madness, the Colossi sought an escape from the hellscape that the world had become. United in intent but separate in location, they dug their way into the earth, and waited there until the dirt caved in and jammed their internal clockworks. The Colossi still lie sleeping just below the planet's surface, and in recent times natural weather cycles and curious mortals have eroded away the earth that protects them from the waking world. If a Colossus were to be fully unearthed and their clockwork processes to resume spinning, the world might again know their power.
