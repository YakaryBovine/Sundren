>"I'm pretty sure that wasn't me", says the miner, having just caused yet another earthquake.

The aftermath of [[The Last War|the Last War]] practically eliminated inter-city trade and rendered agriculture impossible without the use of advanced technology, causing the rapid extinction of settlements that were not already self-sufficient or near enough. The few communities that managed to survive were situated in highly defensible locations and far from the sites of elemental destruction that dotted the continent. Even those experienced a vast majority population dip.

Most settlements in [[The Dredge||the Dredge]] were established around exploitable resources or terrain features, many of which were uncovered by the War itself. Splint was no exception. Mere decades ago, valiant post-War explorers located an unnatural chasm with an exposed [[Leyline]] vein resting against its inner wall. The explorers did not know what the Leyline was, but did recognize its eminent power, and after some trial and error managed to chip away a section of it. The group's spellcasters were able to inhale crushed fragments of the extracted Leyline, fueling their [[Magic#Arcane|magical powers]] enough to be able to mystically conjure food, water and shelter. Recognizing the potential of this newfound resource, they established a makeshift settlement against the chasm wall and named it Splint.

Since then, Splint's population has boomed, in part due to its Leyline exports but primarily owing to the radically increased mystical longevity of its expanded spell-caster population. However, the land surrounding Splint is wracked by alarmingly regular earthquakes, and the soil is dead to the touch. The residents of Splint blame the local Earth [[Elemental|Elementals]] led by [[Koom'durg]]. They don't realize - or simply don't care - that their exploitation of the Leyline is destroying the world even further, and in the long run, damaging the Arcane fabric that they rely on to survive.
