The unification of the the [[Solassian Concordat]] was not an easy affair, nor was its result particularly cohesive in its early days. Throughout the Concordat's history, numerous separatists factions have actively sought greater autonomy or simply full independence. One such group, dubbing itself the [[Iron Conclave]], conspired openly for the reestablishment of an independent [[Grimthain Dynasty]]. Despite the Conclave's audacity, the Solassian Concordat faced immense difficulty quashing them, for the Conclave held their seat of power in an extremely well-fortified underground cavern named Bar'duum. Concordat forces that tried to assault Bar'duum directly were met with an array of traps, confusing mazes, and embedded anti-magic.

As the might of the Iron Conclave grew, so too did the frustration of the Solassian Concordat. The situation came to its apex when the Conclave assassinated a Solassian loyalist chaplain in broad daylight, and the Concordat was forced to bring its full might to bear against the separatists. They gathered together their most powerful [[Druid|Druids]] and [[Cleric|Clerics]], and with their might combined tore the entirety of Bar'duum from the basin's crust, and flung it into the sky. There it stayed, suspended one mile above [[Light's Dawn]] like an orbiting planetoid. The traps contained within proved to be just as effective at keeping occupants in as invaders out. Bar'duum became the Iron Conclave's prison and a radical symbol of the Concordat's divine writ, bringing an end to the age of separatism. As the old members of the Iron Conclave died out, Bar'duum was refurnished as an ultra-maximum security prison for the Concordat's most formidable criminals and prisoners of war, containing tailored equipment designed to inhibit the powers of those captured.

As [[The Last War|the Last War]] raged on and resources became increasingly scarce, maintaining Bar'duum and its inhabitants became increasingly hard to justify for the Solassian Concordat, and several prominent generals advocated lowering the planetoid and executing the prisoners rather than risk their escape in the midst of such an important conflict. However, a prominent Pit Fiend named [[Gorgoborymos]] came to the Concordat and offered them an alternative: they could hand over the administration of Bar'duum to Gorgoborymos and his servants, and in exchange he would lend several legions of his Devils to the war effort. In their desperation, the Concordat signed the contract. Now ruled over by [[Devil|Devils]], Bar'duum became even more of a hellscape than it already was as its prisoners were subjected to horrific tortures which could only be escaped if they offered up their souls in contract. 

Bar'duum met its end when the Solassian Concordat tore down the barriers to the elemental planes, which had the side effect of empowering several [[Elementalist]] inhabitants of Bar'duum - namely [[Kotheia]] and [[Min'thai]] of the [[New Gods]]. Together, they were able to instigate a prison break, slaying several Devil wardens and crashing Bar'duum into Light's Dawn.

Though many prisoners escaped in the confusion, many did not. Even with the Last War long over, Bar'duum remains sunk into the crater of dirt and ruined architecture it created, and its more long-lived inhabitants still languish in torment as their captors continue tirelessly in their effort to procure powerful souls.
