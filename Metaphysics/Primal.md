When a [[Spirit]]'s first discovery in the [[Material Plane]] is a natural concept such as gravity, stone, or a particular species, that Spirit becomes deeply attached to it and becomes a Primal. It forms its entire personality around it and makes it its eternal mission to defend that concept against radical change. Only one Spirit can occupy the thought-space of a natural concept. Some natural concepts have remained static since the beginning of time, and the Awakened Spirits representing them are nearly as old as creation itself. 

Primals are non-sentient, and have no behavioural traits in common with mortals. Instead, they emulate the instinctual behaviour and physical composition of the concept they reflect. The Primal of clouds appears as an enormous, many-faced cloud, while the Primal of fire appears similar to a Fire Elemental and is brash and aggressive without reason. Primals are incapable of entering the Material Plane. Instead, they influence it through the exertion of reality-bending powers that can only manifest in places at which their chosen concept is present, and only in ways that are related to the chosen concept. Despite their limited scope, the most ancient of Primals are extraordinarily powerful, exceeding most Gods in terms of raw power.

Mortals that act in accordance with a Primal's instinctual desires are capable of drawing on its reality-bending power, though the Primal is usually unaware of this happening and makes no conscious decision as to whether or not to allow it. Some particularly wise mortals are capable of forming connections with many Primals at once, for they hold no rivalries against each other. These mortals are called [[Druid|Druids]]. They are invested in defence of the natural world as Primals are, through their interpretation of how to go about it is often more complex and subjective.
