## Premise
The [[Sunlancer]] is a divine object that floats above the sea. Every few months it fires down a massive blast of holy fire on a [[Stålråd]] supply depot, allowing it to be accessed. The players start the session near the blast radius, waiting it to fire. When it's ready, they'll delve into the facility and try to get what they need within the time limit (6 hours).
