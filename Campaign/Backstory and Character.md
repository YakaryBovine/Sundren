## Creating a character that plays well with others
In my game, we focus on the adventures we share at the table rather than the things we write away from it. I only want to see characters that contribute to that shared experience, and for that, simple is best. All characters must meet the following criteria. I am happy to assist in character creation if asked.

Throughout this guidance, consider this exemplar backstory: 
>"Caedor is a wizened elder from a small village who discovered her magical talents late in life. Now aching for magical knowledge to add to her already expansive mundane repertoire, she seeks to delve into the most dangerous of dungeons to find the most esoteric of spells."

1. Focus on personality, not backstory.
2. Limit backstories to 1-3 sentences.
3. Make a character that's deeply invested in whatever the campaign is about.
4. Make sure you understand the basics of the [[#Creating a character that fits in the universe|world you're playing]], and make your character fit neatly into that world.
5. Ensure your character wants to adventure with the party. No loners, no character conflict, and no refusal of the call to action.
6. Make a skilled character. You're doing dangerous things in a dangerous world, so your character needs to be someone who can pull their weight and isn't afraid to do it.
7. No secrets. We're not going to spend any time exploring your character's secrets at the table.
8. No strong opinions that impede your character's ability to do the adventure or work with other characters. You can't have a problem with Necromancy if one of your party members is a Necromancer, because it wouldn't make any sense for you to adventure with each other.
9. Don’t include prejudices around race, gender, or sexuality.
10. No plot hooks in your backstory. I'm not going to be using your backstory to create adventures. If you want to have goals of your own, just set them during play.
11. No independent worldbuilding. Exploring the world is part of the experience, and contributing to the building of it yourself takes away from that. If it's key to your backstory that a certain kind of thing exists in the world, let me know, and I'll tell you if I can work it in.

> [!NOTE] A character to be built upon
> You might be thinking that only 1-2 sentences for a backstory results in an overly simple character, and that Caedor would not make a good character in a novel. That's by design; Caedor is a starting point who is designed to be a good character to play alongside. Caedor can and should evolve over the course of the game, as her experiences tackling danger with the party shape her personality further. We can thus enjoy Caedor's character together, in a way that contributes to everyone's fun, rather than the writing of Caedor's backstory being a largely solitary exercise.

## Creating a character that fits in the universe
Your character is an adventurer in the shattered universe of Sundered, a world set in the hollowed out ruins of once-great civilizations left barren by a total war. Magic exists in the form of ancient relics, enigmatic [[Leyline|Leylines]] that respond to the correct rituals, and creatures from [[Spirit World|another world]]. Far-future technology also exists, including nuclear weaponry, power armor, and cloning.

Long ago, the continent the adventure takes place on was destroyed in a [[The Last War|war]] between the [[Stålråd]] and the [[Solassian Concordat]]. The Stålråd rejected magic and pursued high science, achieving wonders beyond any other civilization on the planet, while the Concordant formed a society around the mastery of Arcane and Divine [[Magic|magic]] alike.

The world is a dangerous place. Surviving in the barren wasteland is hard enough; civilizations that can grow food are few and far between, most freshwater has been evaporated, and the wilds offer up little bounty. Worse than that, the horrifying technological and magical weapons produced by the Stålråd and the Concordant still roam the plains, ranging from the terrifying Stålråd [[Screamer|Screamers]] to Solassian [[Lich|Liches]] trying to continue the old war.

Somehow, your character is surviving in this hostile universe. Decide how. Maybe they are recently awoken from a time bubble or [[Cryogenic Capsule]], maybe they are an immortal species or [[Warforged|robot]], or maybe they were born in one of the few surviving human civilizations.

Your character has joined an adventuring group with all of the other players at the table, and they now seek to pursue something in the world. Decide who these other adventurers are to you, why you have taken up the call to adventure, and what you now want out of life. You should work with the DM and the other players to figure this out.
