You may leave any session, any time, for any reason, with no hard feelings. It might be because you're uncomfortable with something that came up that wasn't included in the [[Content Warning]] or a communication beforehand, you might feel ill, or you might just realize you weren't up to it that night. Either way, please feel free to go home when you need to. Of course, leaving repeatedly might raise questions about whether or not this campaign is for you - but it won't result in me or any other player being annoyed with you.

You may also leave the campaign at any time, again without any hard feelings. Not every campaign is for everyone, and you might only realize it partway through. I would much rather that a player that's not having fun leave my campaign than trudge through it unhappily. If we're friends, we can continue to hang out in other contexts.
