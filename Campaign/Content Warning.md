Fantasy is often violent, so I may include content like death, slavery, human experimentation, psychological horror, body horror, gore, and torture. However, these will not be glorified or described in detail, and they won’t ever be presented in a way that doesn’t allow you as heroes to try to deal with them. I will never depict sexual assault, familiar forms of bigotry, or uncomfortable violations of your character. If you have any boundaries beyond this, let me know at any time and we can discuss.
