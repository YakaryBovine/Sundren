My game is an OSR sandbox that focuses on players using skill expression and game mastery to pursue character goals with extensive freedom. It's important to understand that I'm not running the narratively-focused heroic fantasy you might have come to expect from the likes of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, Critical Role, Dimension 20, and Baldurâ€™s Gate 3, and that that playstyle will not carry over to my game well. 

My campaign will feature:
- A [[Sandbox|sandbox]], where the players drive the game forward by pursuing their goals, and I use the world to react in compelling ways
- [[Backstory and Character|Minimalist player backstory]]
- A [[The Rules|mechanics]]-driven narrative; the story emerges from the game
- Player success or failure that hinges on [[Solving Problems|intelligent decision making]], both in character creation and active play

It will NOT feature:
- A linear narrative where the DM presents a plot for the players to react to
- Extensive player backstory
- An emphasis on narrative over mechanics
- Player character power fantasy
- An assumption of player success
