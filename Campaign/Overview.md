My game is an OSR sandbox that focuses on players using skill expression and game mastery to pursue character goals with extensive freedom.

My campaign will feature:
- A [[Sandbox|sandbox]], where the players drive the game forward by pursuing their goals, and I use the world to react in compelling ways
- [[Backstory and Character|Minimalist player backstory]]
- A [[The Rules|mechanics]]-driven narrative; the story emerges from the game
- Player success or failure that hinges on [[Solving Problems|intelligent decision making]], both in character creation and active play
- The use of some custom [[Tools|tools]], and this Obsidian vault

It will NOT feature:
- A linear narrative where the DM presents a plot for the players to react to
- Extensive player backstory
- An emphasis on narrative over mechanics
- Player character power fantasy
- An assumption of player success
