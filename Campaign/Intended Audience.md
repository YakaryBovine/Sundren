I’m looking for players that are:
- Fans of fantasy
- Over the age of 20
- At least a little interested in roleplaying (you don’t have to do voices or speak in first person; third person is just fine)
- Interested in RPG game [[The Rules|mechanics]]; finds building characters, buying and using gear, and rolling dice satisfying
- Interested in playing an old-school [[Sandbox|sandbox]] RPG
- Team players who prioritize the fun of the game we share
- Able to commit to a regular weekly or fortnightly session and show up 80% of the time, and who will notify me as soon as reasonably possible on days they cannot make it
