As [[The Last War|the Great War]] dragged on, it became clear to the most powerful Wizards and Clerics of the [[Solassian Concordat]] that the conflict might endure longer than their own lifespans. Not wanting to forsake their fellows, they sought to expand their lifespans through any means necessary. Some infused their souls into phylacteries, guaranteeing that they would be able to participate in the war indefinitely. Tragically, the liches themselves outlasted the conflict by several hundred years. They now reside in obscured towers and deep mists, working endlessly towards unknown aims.
