An Obsidian vault containing worldbuilding lore and rules for my homebrew world, Sundered.
>Long ago, an empire of collectivist magic-users clashed with a faction of individualist technologists over fundamental ideological differences. The resulting war and its arms race tor the world asunder. Now we stride across the ashes of a once-glorious country, nipping at the heels of dead giants.
### Campaign
The central purpose of this vault is to support running a Worlds Without Number sandbox campaign in Christchurch. The Campaign section contains details on what my game is, how I'll be running it, the rules we'll be using, and how you should approach it. If you're playing in my game, you must read the entire section *before* we start a long campaign. Start with [[Overview]].
### Rules
The Rules section contains all of the rules relevant to playing in my campaign. The vast majority of them are taken from [Worlds Without Number by Kevin Crawford](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348791/worlds-without-number), with minor alterations to the wording, formatting, and content to fit my game.

If you're just getting started, I recommend starting with [[Character Creation]].
### Worldbuilding
The Worldbuilding section contains everything relevant to my homebrew universe, Sundered. It takes inspiration from Dragon Age, the Forgotten Realms, and Kenshi. It's a post-apocalyptic, science-fiction fantasy world intended to serve as the backdrop to a sandbox table-top roleplaying game.

If you're playing in my campaign, you'll notice that you only have access to articles of lore that your party has already discovered in-game. You should only read the parts you're interested in, but if you want to read for its own sake, I recommend starting with [[The Last War]].
