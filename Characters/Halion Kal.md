Halion was the 406th High Administrator of [[Altena]], a prolific inventor, and an eccentric individual even by [[St책lr책d]] standards. His administration of the city was haphazard and frustratingly inconsistent by all appearances, but in spite of that Altena ran like clockwork. Industrialists and businessmen decried his name when they drank together in their favourite venues, and they often wondered aloud how it was that such a crazed man could be continually re-elected - but when it came time for their turns in the voting booths, few could earnestly deny the efficacy of his governance, and he continued to win.

In truth, Halion was a logistical savant, able to interpret and manipulate the flows of automation and research. Where other administrators recognized the importance of rules and regulations that tended processes towards efficiency, Halion simply saw cause and effect progressing forward in an indefinite helix, and he knew how to find the right causes to produce a given series of desired outcomes. He never attempted to explain his decision making process to his constituents, correctly assuming that they would not understand.

Prior to the Last War, Halion objected to the betrayal and imprisonment of [[Fyfrii]], arguing that the resulting conflict would cripple the St책lr책d beyond repair. When his warnings were ignored and the God was imprisoned beneath the world, the Solassian Concordat declared total war, and the High Administrator retreated to his workshop to seek out a path that would avert the inevitable devastation. He found none at all, and instead devised the Cryogenic Capsules, hoping that he could at least preserve enough lives to propagate a successor civilization. 

In the end, he determined that the most effective role he could play in the conflict would not end in his survival. He devised a plan to destroy [[The Last Legion]] during their assault on Altena, overloading the city's reactor system to annihilate it and everyone inside as it was drawn into the resulting black hole. Halion remained in Altena when it was annihilated, knowing that if he evacuated the gambit would have been revealed.
