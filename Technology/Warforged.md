In an effort to bolster their forces after a series of devastating manpower losses in the Great War, the [[Stålråd]] forged an army of mindless humanoid golems that could serve both on the front lines and as untiring laborers. Their participation in the conflict ensured that the War could continue even as organic populations were decimated. 

When the War ended, the Warforged lost their purpose and most simply ceased functioning, allowing their bodies to rust. Those that survived chose to do so because their immediate circumstances still somehow matched the requirements set by their operating systems. Some continued to defend withering Stålråd structures, while others became bodyguard detail for any mortal Stålråd-aligned survivors they could find, and some continued to harvest resources natural resources to stockpile them at designated depots.
