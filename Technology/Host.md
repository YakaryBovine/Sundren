As the War escalated, it became clear that the inability of the [[Warforged]] to replicate the creativity, initiative and decision-making of sentient humanoids rendered them much less effective soldiers. Worse still, the [[St책lr책d]] continued to lose their most competent admirals and generals to assassinations, diseases and time, and these could not be so easily replaced. This problem was solved by the invention of the Hosts, Warforged with empty brains into which the minds of adequately useful near-death mortals could be transferred. Whether or not Hosts carried true sentient minds or simply artificial copies of them remained an unanswered question to the St책lr책d, but the military advantage conveyed by harnessing immortal wooden-metallic warrior lords could not be denied.
