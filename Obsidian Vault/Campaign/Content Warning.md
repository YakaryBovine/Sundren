I want to make sure that everyone is comfortable at the table, so we will tread lightly with certain topics. 

- **Lines** are topics not permitted in the game at all. 
- **Veils** are topics that may come up, but when they do, they won't be described in detail.
- **Ask first** topics will only be included after getting permission from the player. These will only include things happening *to* players.
- **Open** topics are not restricted at all, and are core aspects of the game or genre we're exploring. 

If you have any topics to add to this list, please communicate them to me, ideally before they come up. I generally won't remove major content from a session unless it was communicated beforehand, but I do have an [[Open Door Policy|open door policy]].
