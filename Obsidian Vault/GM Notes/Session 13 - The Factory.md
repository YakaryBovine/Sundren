IN DEFIANCE OF STEEL WE KNOW THREE
AND IN DEFIANCE OF SUN WE KNEW ONE
WITNESS OUR BETRAYAL IN THIS TEMPLE
AND KNOW OUR HATE IS INWARD BOUND

The abandoned factory is a front for a Stalrad temple. The players are able to find the entrance easily due to having godly artifacts.

This factory is where the Triumvirate learned to build their cool energy trinket they gave to Skofnildr. 

Once they realized what they’d done, they built replicas of the Gods and killed themselves in a ritual to create an immortal depiction of their misdeeds.
## [[Khalumet]] fight
KHALUMET. GOD OF UNITY AGAINST THE OUTSIDER
KNOW YOUR PLACE
- One player is marked as the Outsider. They must “die”. Anything else resets the fight. The Outsider can’t feel pain, and they regenerate their health after each fight
## [[Urhat-Zel]] fight
- Fights with allies. Any attempt to damage the allies damages the God instead. When the God is staggered, exposed wiring in his neck is revealed. Attacking the wiring resets the fight. Fixing it is a win
## [[Ashur-Namta]] fight
- The fight takes place on a pillar surrounded by darkness. Abundance fights, and is sometimes inclined to try throw a player off. Getting all players AND Abundance off wins the fight, as Desolation has occurred
## [[Skofnildr]] fight
SKOFNILDR. GOD OF REJECTING DIVINITY FOR PETTY TRINKETS
- Simply gift him the trinket

## The device
- Mercy built a wooden housing frame.
- Abundance built a metal rod to be pushed through the center with three beads on it.
- Unity coiled a strip of bronze around it and pinned it to one end of the rod.

Altogether, the rod can be pushed with the hand to make a satisfying click, and when released the spring pushes it back with a few inconsistent thuds.
