## Forsyning
The players just need to finish the dungeon they're in. They have 3 encounters:
### Plant room
20 HP +7 attack plants. On a hit and every turn after, get pulled 10ft further into the wall or floor. Fire inflicts double damage.
### Caretaker room
Normal Warforged, but every time it dies a new Caretaker spawns from a capsule. If they realize what's happening, they have an emergency button that opens up 4 additional capsules. Knocking all existing Caretakers out stops the spawning.
## Robot room
A fricking huge robot. Written on the walls in blood, revealed by neon lights, are commands that can be used to manipulate the robot. The robot moves at 30 feet, has 100  HP, and 22 Armor Class.

It can perform 2 of 3 actions per turn: Move (30ft), Fire Missile, and Drill. 

**Drill:** Annihilates a melee target, dealing 1d10+2 damage at +5 attack.
**Fire Missile:** Always hits and deals 2d8 damage in a 10ft radius, halved for a successful Dexterity save. The gun is like a jammed revolver. The first time it rolls a number on a d8, it expels liquid from the gun. If it ever rolls that number again, it fires.

The robot can be made to waste one of its actions via the terminal. On a DC 10 Program check or a DC 14 Know check, the typist can enter two commands at once.

**Reboot:** The robot loses an ENTIRE turn.
**Halt and catch fire:** The robot catches fire, taking 4d12 damage at the end of each of its turns.
**Open fire protocol:** The robot becomes hostile to EVERYTHING, including the caretakers.
**Up/down/left/right:** The robot spends one of its actions moving in this manner. 
## Hospice
The party will come into Hospice and get some choice descriptions about where they are. There will then be plenty of adventure hooks available in the [[Hospice#The Fringe Market]]:
- **Koom’durg’s Request (or Refusal):** A trio of earth elementals seeks the Earth Primal’s corpse to destroy it and claim its mantle, but currently refuse mortal aid due to their perceived weakness.
- **The Limbless Collector:** A Collector with no remaining limbs offers riches to anyone who will carry them on an adventure—destination unknown, but tied to their past.
- **The Devil’s Hand:** A Collector desires the severed, intact hand of a powerful Devil believed to be housed in the asteroid-prison Bar’duum, and wants the party to get themselves captured to retrieve it.
- A recent earthquake uncovered a battlefield which probably has lots of limbs. A group of adventurers led by Barnoldus wants to go there to get stuff for the Collectors.
- A village is under imminent attack from a horde of 100 Screamers in 24 hours and they desperately need help. An exhausted old man, elder of their village, named Grin.
- A scavenger crew thinks they can salvage a Titan's eye from Finality. They are led by Firetta, a sniper who watches her crew from afar and communicates via walkie-talkie.
