The players will attempt to defend a village from 100 invading Screamers. The village is situated on a safe mountaintop, at the top of which is a dance hall.

The village consists of 90 fighting-age adults, 70 elderly, and 100 children.
## Mechanics
### Phase 0
The invading force consists of 100 Screamers, divided into 10 "Hostile Assets".
The defending force will fight with some number of Defense Asset. By default, they have 1: Barnoldus and his mercenaries.

The Screamer force will invade in 4 days. Each day, the party may take 3 Scene Actions per player, for a total of 12 Scene Actions. They should describe something they are doing to enhance the town's defenses, then make a skill check to determine efficacy, with the following possible results:
- Nothing happens
- They gain a Defense Asset
- One or more of their Defense Assets gains an Asset Bonus, ranging from +1 to +3
### Phase 1
When the battle commences, Phase 1 starts, and the following happens concurrently:
- Every Hostile Asset is paired up with one or more Defense Assets. Each side rolls 1d10 per Asset, and destroys the resulting number of forces from the opposing Asset. Assets with Asset Bonuses ignore 1 loss they would take and inflict 1 additional loss per bonus.
- The player party may choose to battle any number of Screamers personally, in their own separate section of the fight.
### Phase 2
After this, Phase 2 occurs:
- All remaining Friendly Assets survive but are exhausted, and may no longer participate in the battle
- The players must personally confront any remaining Screamers, in any battlefield configuration they can come up with in the town
