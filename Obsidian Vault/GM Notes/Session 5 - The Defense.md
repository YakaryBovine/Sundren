Order of operations:
1. Players tell me how many Screamers they're going to fight, and show me the fight setup they want to have. Maybe some rolls if the encounter area is complex.
2. The first round of the fight starts, with initiative resolving as follows:
	1. Players in Screamer combat first.
	2. The Screamers themselves.
	3. [[Lilith]] and Lelsie.
3. When Lilith and Lelsie take their turn, Lamensyat will take Lelsie into their realm, then demand MORE. They will bathe the entire town in dance magic. For the rest of the session, the players gain Japanese dance themed abilities and the Screamers gain synthwave ones.
4. The townspeople resolve their defense against the Screamers, rolling as per the rules.
5. The players must then fight all remaining Screamers. Initiative is normal.
## Dance actions
Each round, you can use one Dance action. You can also infuse it with a hidden meaning to get the *hidden meaning* effect, but you have to pass a Perform/CHA or Perform/DEX check with a DC of 9. Dance actions can't be used in the first round of the music, except by Akira and anyone who beats a Perform/DEX check of 11.

- **Across the Floor:** As an On Turn Action, for the rest of your round, you can move up to twice your normal speed. *Hidden meaning:* You can move 
- **It Takes Two:** As an On Turn Action, give an ally your Main Action or Move Action for the round. They must use it immediately, then the turn returns to you. *Hidden meaning:* You give the ally a free Action instead of giving them yours.
- **Repeat Performance:** As an On Turn Action, repeat your last Main Action and Move action as precisely as you can, doing the same thing and moving in the same direction. *Hidden meaning:* Only replicate the bits you want.
- **Haka:** As a Main Action, force any number of opponents that can see and hear you to attack you on their next turn if possible, unless they make a Mental save. *Hidden meaning:* They don't get a save.
## Extra Screamer actions
- **Lightning Launcher:** Deal 1d6+2 damage at range. Bounces to a target within 10 feet, dealing 1d4 damage, then again for 1d2 damage, then again for 1 damage.
- **Intelligence:** The Screamers operate with full intelligence and coordination, and can pick up and use weapons.
## Narrative stuff
### Screamers attack
The invading Scream is piercing even from a distance. One hundred agonized robots sprint at the town, without pause or tire. Your earplugs deafen the sound, but the torture it embodies is harder to handle. The defense, such as it is, stares out from the walls, making no sounds loud enough to cut through the piercing yell. Thirty minutes later, the Screamers are upon you.
### The dance
As Lelsie dances, her movements growing more and more extravagant with each move, her visage is carried all throughout the room. In each of the long mirrors along the dancehall you see Lelsie; first two, then four, then eight, and finally sixteen copies of her dancing all throughout your vision. Soon all these visions fade away, and replacing them you see sixteen individual dancers; all quite elegant, but each their own, and each dancing to their own choreography. The dance hall is bathed with a washed pink light, and behind those dancers - mirrored on each side of the hall - you see a resplendent figure watching from a piano throne. They are draped languidly across the chair with an uncanny grace, their bare silver feet bouncing to the sound of the music, which you now realize is in your head rather than in the hall. "Brilliant. I can see it all... The falsity. So many layers. *More*." The sixteen dancers jerk to a stop, then begin performing Lelsie's dance. "Good... But... *More.*" The faded pink light spills out from the hall and into the town.
### Out in the fight
The Screamers stop screaming. It is eerily quiet for a moment. But then you hear a faint, electric hum. It repeats steadily. Then a broken synthline. Then, finally, the slow bass pulse. The screamers stop moving, except when the beat strikes - then they move in unison. The Screamer onslaught continues in synthwave neon lockstep.

Behind the electric hum you hear another song. That of a foundling conqueror nation from far off lands, formed hundreds of years ago, dominating once-proud city states. You hear the haunting shakuhachi, thekoto, and the shamisen. And under it all you hear a lie; that this conqueror nation was born not of bravery but cowardice and loneliness, as the founders ran from a land that did not accept them.
