## The attack
The party is attacked by the [[Eryndottirs]], consisting of [[Brynja Kolstad]] the cyborg, [[Haldren Vekk]] the Warforged, [[Ingrid Skaarvik]] the Giant, and [[Soren Veyndahl]] the clone. They want the party's nuclear power core because they don't trust them with it.
## Their goals
The Eryndottirs want to find out what the Stalrad did to "win" the war, as ostensibly they shouldn't have stood a chance. This has four main components:
- Go to Big Fish and steal their submarine. Autopilot it to another country to survey the land.
- Go to the observatory in the wilderness and find out what the extra four stars in the sky are.
- Go to [[Tollard]] and find out how [[Gorgoborymos]] and his devils were able to make, and sustain, the [[Bloodwake]].
- Go to the abandoned Stalrad manufacturing facility outside [[Eberhar]], supposedly a front for a [[Triumvirate]] temple, to find out how the Stalrad were able to deal with the [[Urzithan Concordat|Urzithan]] [[God|Gods]].
## Major locations
[[Valdishal]], the city of genetics, now ravaged by mutants.
[[Strynholt]], the city of Warforged, ruled by a mostly sane Titan.
[[Tollard]], the city of power, annihilated by the [[The Last Legion]] and shadowed by [[Obzidon]].
[[Eberhar]], the city of innovation, now destroyed by [[Gorgoborymos]] and his [[Draugr]].
