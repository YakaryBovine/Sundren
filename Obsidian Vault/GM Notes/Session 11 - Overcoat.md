# Draugr
## Overview
The players have been ambushed by Draugr in the cold.
When a Draugr reaches 5 or fewer hit points, it is slain instantly by a nearby Draugr, who regains all of their hit points and gains +1 to AC, Damage, Shock, Save, and Attack.

# Overcoat observatory
## Overview
The players will try to access an observatory in the wilderness. This Stalrad observatory is occupied by a single wastelander, who finds the place very comfortable and doesn't want to lose it. He's sitting in the top observatory. Every Dungeon Turn, he'll have an opportunity to activate one of the observatory's systems to try to kill the players. Not all the systems are military-grade; some might be part of normal operation of the observatory but used in a lethal manner.
## Rooms
1. Generator room
	1. Exposed high voltage cables emitting electricity. Use insulating material or navigate carefully
	2. Nuclear generator
	3. Giant plug that can plug directly into the elevator, but it's not long enough
2. Data archives
	1. Easily accessible medical chart (Program DC6)
	2. Download the full identity pass of the Chief Medical Officer (Program DC14)
3. Maintenance bay
	1. Very greasy floors
	2. Has a whole pile of basic, random equipment you might want to use
	3. A hovertrike; a three-wheeled hover bike with repulsorlift pads. Can glide over things. Uses Type B Power Cells for charge.
4. Dormitory quarters
	1. Contains some basic logs about the activities here
5. Water reclamation & life support
	1. Can be used to repressurize the atmosphere
6. Security station
	1. Can be used to override the lockdown with a DC14 program check
	2. Has a land mine under the chief security officer's desk
7. Astronomy workshop
	1. Fully powered
	2. Power can be diverted away via a terminal
8. Supply storage
	1. Extender cords for the generator room
9. Trauma bay
	1. Trauma bots
	2. Corpses hacked together (one of them is the Chief Medical Officer)
	3. Scanner that tells you the identity of the person
10. High Command elevator
	1. No power
	2. Dangerous airlock
	3. Security lockdown via medical activation
## Reaching High Command
There is an elevator in the middle leading to High Command, but it is heavily locked down. They need to overcome three problems, which exist in layers.
1. All of the backup power has been routed to the Astronomy Workshop. It can be rerouted via a computer, OR there is a panel near the airlock into which a giant plug can be pushed.
2. The airlock needs to be activated from the inside (this is normal operation). Rapid depressurization harms the occupant/s.
3. The elevator itself is in security lockdown and must be medically activated using a particular corpse from the Trauma Bay, or via a download from the Data Archives. The corpses have been hacked together by dysfunctional medical bots; the players must rebuild one using only the body parts of the actual Chief Medical Officer.
## Squatter actions
Every Dungeon Turn, the Squatter can take an action to harm the players.
- **Vent atmosphere:** Seal the entire facility and vent the air. There are red pushpins on the inside of the facility for emergency release, but they're taped over.
- **Floor is lava:** Turn the underfloor heating up way too high, singing the player's feet when they try to walk on it.
- **Magnetic lockdown:** Supercharge the hallway with magnets, preventing the use of metal equipment.
- **Reactor scare:** A fakes overload countdown from the nuclear reactor.
- **Release medical drones:** Unleash a large swarm of medical drones to dissect the players.
- **General Alrun:** Activate a bobblehead with the voice of General Alrun to trick the players into walking into a trap.
- **Deactivate lights:** Turn off the lights.
- **Ceiling turret:** Activate ceiling turrets outside the central elevator.
