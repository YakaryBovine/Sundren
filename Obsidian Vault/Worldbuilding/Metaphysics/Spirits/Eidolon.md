Some individual animals are so important to a particular culture or region that their legends permeate through decades of folklore. When one of these legendary creatures finally passes away, and a [[Spirit]] crosses over to this world and discovers the tales surrounding it, an Eidolon is born. The Eidolon takes the material form of the deceased animal, but with additional powers, knowledge, strength, and visual markings befitting the tales told.

Eidolons possess a level of intelligence and wisdom in accordance with their originating tales. Some are extraordinarily clever, while others maintain only a bestial instinct.

[[Shaman]]s can derive their mysticism from sufficiently powerful Eidolons, but they represent a precarious form of power; Eidolons will only grant their powers to those they respect, so Shamans must practice a combination of strength, wisdom, or submission, depending on the Eidolon in question.
