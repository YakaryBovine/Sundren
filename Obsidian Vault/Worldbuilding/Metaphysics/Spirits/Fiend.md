When a [[Spirit]]'s first discovery in the [[Material Plane]] is a particular act of great evil, such as a murder or a genocide, that Spirit becomes obsessed with the evil act and seeks to understand the motivations behind it. Invariably, the Spirit succeeds, and develops a great empathy for the evildoer and the emotions - or lines of reasoning - that led to the act of evil. The Spirit then manifests in the world as a Fiend, choosing a form and function that best encapsulates the witnessed evil. Sometimes, newly born Fiends will seek out their patron evildoer in order to aid them, particularly if the act was sufficiently heinous.

Fiends are invariably evil. A Fiend cannot experience a kind thought, nor are they motivated by anything except malice. However, Fiends differ in how they deliver violence upon the mortal world. Fiends that are born from methodical evil such as torture, tyranny and assassination become Devils. These Fiends are clever, rational and patient, and are uniquely capable of travelling between the Material and the Ethereal. They follow stringent ranking systems amongst themselves, and the pain that they deliver is efficient and reasoned. Conversely, Fiends that are born from wanton evil such as assault, hatred and bigotry become Demons. These Fiends are wild, reckless and gratuitous. They rarely if ever form connections amongst themselves, and their violence is constant, unrelenting and often untargeted.

Elder Fiends, who have survived on the Material Plane for at least several decades, come to find that the pain they can inflict on mortal bodies is insufficient to satiate their hunger. They learn to harvest the [[Soul]]s of mortals, plucking them from their bodies moments before death. Elder Devils transform sections of the [[Ethereal Plane]] into elaborate torture zones, ferrying souls there to experience indefinite agony, and occasionally sharing their spoils with lesser Devils in exchange for their service. Elder Demons simply consume souls directly, housing them inside an internal biological furnace. Either way, these souls can only be released to the beyond by destroying the Elder Fiend.
