When a [[Spirit]]'s first discovery in the [[Material Plane]] is a particular act of great kindness, compassion or self-sacrifice, that Spirit becomes obsessed with the good act and seeks to understand the motivations behind it. Invariably, the Spirit succeeds, and develops a great empathy for the good-doer and the emotions - or lines of reasoning - that led to the act of good. The Spirit then manifests in the world as a Celestial, choosing a form and function that well encapsulates the witnessed good. If the committed act was sufficiently benevolent, the Celestial will seek out the good-doer in order to aid them, and will occasionally incorporate their patron's visage into their own appearance.   

Celestials are invariably good. A Celestial cannot experience an unkind thought, nor are they motivated by anything except benevolence. However, Celestials differ in how they seek to improve the wellbeing of the world. Celestials that are born from rational good such as the vigilant practice of law or the long-term application of philosophy become Archons. These Archons are intelligent, rational and rigid. They work together in strict hierarchies to ensure that the rules that spawned them continue to function for the collective good. Conversely, Celestials that are born from spontaneous good such as justified rebellion or a sudden act of protection become Angels. These Angels are independent and have great initiative. They act alone and with little regard for their own safety or the bigger picture, doing whatever good they can with whatever tools they have at the time. Although Celestials are always well-intentioned, they do not always succeed in producing good; Celestials can be excessively rigid in their application, and the failure of Angels to consider long-term consequences can be catastrophic.   

Many Celestials align themselves closely with one or more good-aligned [[God]]s that have similar missions. Virtually all Archons serve a single God long-term due to their need for order, while Angels will flit between different Gods and independence according to their needs at the time.
