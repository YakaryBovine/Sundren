In the metaphysical structure of the known world, a Soul is the animating essence of all mortal beings. Unlike [[Spirit]]s, which originate from the ever-shifting [[Spirit World]], Souls are innately tied to the mortal body, born within it and extinguished - in due time - after death.

Every mortal is born with a Soul that is unique and indivisible. A Soul provides true free will and the spark of consciousness, and together with the brain and body forms the sum total of a creature's existence. It cannot be cloned or duplicated. There is no entity in the universe capable of forging a true Soul; they simple are, and always were.

Souls are bound to the body during life via a connection both biological and metaphysical. The severance of this bond - whether by natural death, violence, or magical intervention - releases the Soul from its earthly vessel.
### Death
Upon death, a Soul does not vanish instantly. It lingers in the world for a time, before it inevitably dissipates back into the world's unseen energies to be born again in a distant future.

Some Souls linger longer than others. Individuals with a deep and unresolved attachment to a place, people, or unfinished purpose persist in the world as [[Ghost]]s, subtly but barely-perceptibly influencing the world for tens or hundreds of years before their eventual dissipation.

Mortals who have pledged themselves to a [[God]] may have their Souls ferried to their benefactor's domain within the Spirit World, to enjoy the afterlife promised to them until they, too, dissipate back into the Material World.

Those unfortunate enough to be slaughtered by a [[Fiend#Demon|Demon]] or become involved in a [[Fiend#Devil|Devil]]'s scheme run the risk of having their Soul captured, to be burned as fuel within an internal furnace or trapped in a realm of torment until the moment of their second demise.
### Magic
Souls are notoriously difficult to manipulate by magical means. While [[Magic#Spiritual|Spirit Magic]] generally cannot affect Souls at all, [[Magic#Arcane|Arcane Magic]]—particularly in its [[Necromancy|Necromantic]] forms—can interact with them in minor ways. Skilled necromancers can sever the Soul from the body, causing death, or extract residual impressions for purposes such as interrogation or memory scrying.

Even Magic cannot properly rebind a Soul to a body once it has left. True resurrection is impossible, not the least because Gods are invariably unwilling to relent the Souls of their followers, but also because it would violate foundational metaphysical laws. Attempts to do so will produce, at best, half-alive abominations twisted by profound pain and confusion.
