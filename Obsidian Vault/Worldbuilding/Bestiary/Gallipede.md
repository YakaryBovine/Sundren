The gallipede is a massive, multi-legged creature. The [[Stålråd]] engineered the first gallipedes in the early stages of [[The Last War]], when tunnel collapses, magical interference, and hostile weather made traditional transport systems unreliable. Gallipedes, by contrast, could reproduce naturally, seek out their own food, and autonomously keep themselves safe.

Grown in nutrient vats and vat-born broods, early gallipedes were made to burrow through ruined terrain, dragging cables, weapon pods, or supply canisters through the earth. Their bodies were long and segmented, with dozens of thick legs radiating from armored flanks. A hard, shovel-like skull allowed them to push through collapsed structures or compacted dirt, and a ridged spine gave them stability when pulling heavy sleds over uneven ground. Where eyes might be, they had instead feathery vibration feelers, capable of reading seismic shifts and motion across a wide radius. In low light, glowing bands along their bodies pulsed with internal bioluminescence - a remnant of their laboratory origin, where silent visual cues replaced sound.

Gallipedes are obedient by design. Domesticated specimens imprint on handlers at birth, forming deep loyalty bonds that persist even through trauma or neglect. They respond to tactile signals, light cues, and rhythmic pulses of sound - all methods that allowed handlers to communicate with them without risk of detection during wartime. They are capable of traversing nearly any terrain, from soft dunes to cracked volcanic flats, and can carry or pull enormous loads for days with little rest.
## Diet
Their diet is wide-ranging. A gallipede can chew through root matter, fungi, scavenged carcasses, and even mineral-rich rocks, though they thrive best when fed tailored nutrient slurries rich in silicates and calcium. Though not tireless, they can go for weeks without feeding when exertion is minimal, and recover quickly from injury provided they have time to burrow and rest.
## In [[The Dredge]]
After the collapse of the Stålråd, many gallipede broods escaped or were abandoned. Over the decades, they have bred freely in deep cave systems, old subway lines, and irradiated ravines. Wild strains have diverged from their original design - some growing far larger, some reverting to more insect-like behaviors. But the core traits remain: endurance, loyalty when trained, and an almost eerie silence when in motion.

Today, gallipedes are a common sight among long-range caravans and wasteland traders. Their origins are poorly understood by many of their users, but their utility is undeniable. Strong enough to carry an armored rider and a week’s supplies, careful enough to cross a collapsing bridge, the utility of the gallipede cannot be overstated.
