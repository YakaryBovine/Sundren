Those aware of the past tend to split the calendar into two time periods; Before the End (BE) and After the End (AE). The time periods are separated by the event that ended the [[The Last War]].

**43 BE**: The [[Stålråd]] implement the [[Anathema Doctrine]] doctrine, banning all spirits and magic from their territory.
**8 BE**: [[Urzithan Concordat|Urzithan]] nationalists try to destroy the [[Valdishal Grand Line]], but are stopped by [[Skofnildr]].
**7 BE:** A Stålråd death squad attempts to assassinate a minor Urzithan noble, but instead mistakenly murder the Emperor. The Urzithans declare war on the Stålråd, and both sides begin occupying city state territory in the [[Shattered Expanse]].
**6.5 BE**: The Urzithans build the [[Sunlancer]] and use it to destroy the Stålråd front in the Expanse.
**6.2 BE:** The Stålråd find and detonate the [[Leyline|Leylines]], ruining [[Magic#Arcane|Arcane magic]].
**4 BE:** The Urzithans make a deal with [[Gorgoborymos]] to create the [[Bloodwake]], allowing [[Fiend|Devils]] to pour forth and take over [[Eberhar]].
**3 BE:** The Stålråd unleash the [[Colossus|Titans]], who manage to pull [[Light's Dawn]] from the sky before abandoning their mission at [[Finality]].
**0.6 BE:** The [[Triumvirate]] give Skofnildr a novel energy device they built themselves. This drives him insane and allows them to join the war in earnest, devastating the Stålråd.
**0.4 BE:** The Stalrad enact [[Operation Oblivion]], annihilating every other civilization on the planet to deprive the Triumvirate of power.
**1 AE:** The war ends.
**1.2 AE:** The Stalrad High Command escape to the moon, ready to awaken when all is clear.
**1.4 AE:** Urzithan elites escape to the heavens of the Triumvirate through a portal at Exile, a maximum security Urzithan prison, awaiting the day when the Sunlancer breaks them free.
**104 AE:** The game begins.
