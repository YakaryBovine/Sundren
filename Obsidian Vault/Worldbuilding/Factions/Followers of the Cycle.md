>"It's time to let go. We were never meant to last forever."

During [[the Last War]], major participants on both sides were entrusted with immortality so that they might continue the conflict until victory had been achieved. But in the end, neither side prevailed, and instead the surface of the world was swept away in a tragic cataclysm. Surviving a global apocalyptic event took an immense toll on the psyches of the immortals left behind, particularly for those that contributed significantly to the death tally. For some, the resulting guilt became more than just a feeling - it became a philosophy.   

The Cult of the Cycle is a post-War cult led by [[Warforged]], [[Liches]] and [[Undead]] that participated in the Last War. They believe that the Cataclysm was a metaphysical occurrence meant to eliminate the failed and corrupt society that had come to plague the world. Their own survival, as well as that of others, thus represented not only an abject refusal to accept destiny, but an unfortunate barrier to the natural end of the current Cycle as well.   

Convinced that continued existence is no more than a correctable error resulting from the hubris of mortals, the Cult of the Cycle seeks out tools that might allow them to bring about a second, greater apocalypse and end the current Cycle once and for all. They believe that once they do, the [[God|Gods]] will return in full force and repopulate the world with a newer, superior set of mortal races, having learned from their previous mistakes.
