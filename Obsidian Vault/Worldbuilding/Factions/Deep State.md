The Deep State is a secretive shadow council that governs the [[Stålråd]] from behind the scenes. It was created during [[The Last War]], in response to the existential threat posed by [[Urzithan Concordat|Urzithan]] teleportation, mind control, and dream-walking magics. The Stålråd realized that any known commander was a liability—easily targeted, manipulated, or destroyed. A new solution was required.

To ensure survival, the Stålråd developed a limited artificial intelligence, stored on a one-petabyte compact disc. This AI could be inserted into any compatible machine, which would then display a hypnotic sequence of images. The sequence served as a test: only those with fanatical loyalty to the Stålråd and the will to make ruthless decisions could withstand the imagery. Most failed. Those who did were memetically wiped, their minds permanently shattered. Those few who passed were inducted into the Deep State.

Inductees were granted total authority over all Stålråd technologies and systems. Their commands superseded all others. They wore no insignia, bore no public rank, and never revealed themselves. In fact, most of the Stålråd are unaware the Deep State exists at all. Their rule is absolute but invisible.

The Deep State ensured the survival of the Stålråd at a critical moment in history, but at a cost: the council is fanatically loyal, deeply rigid, and ideologically inflexible. It cannot be swayed, negotiated with, or reformed. It acts with absolute conviction in pursuit of the Stålråd cause, whatever the cost.

The compact discs containing the Deep State AI still exist. Though their locations are secret, rumors persist of forgotten bunkers and sealed vaults where the machines still await new candidates. It is entirely possible that new members of the Deep State are still being inducted, even centuries after the war’s end—chosen not by any living authority, but by the will of the system itself.
