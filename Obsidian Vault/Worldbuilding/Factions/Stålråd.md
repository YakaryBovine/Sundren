### History
The ancient city-state of **[[Eberhar]]** was settled by travelers from the [[Northern Plateau]], drawn to the rich veins of iron and copper along the foothills of the [[Romsdal Mountains]]. But Eberhar’s bounty was matched by hardship: the surrounding [[Bongire Taiga]] offered acidic, nutrient-poor podzol soil, and persistent cold that stunted crop growth.

Denied easy agriculture, the city poured its efforts into metallurgy and mechanical innovation. Over time, Eberhar built a production economy of staggering efficiency. Mass-produced tools, modular infrastructure, clever logistics, and determined ingenuity allowed the city to thrive where others would have withered. Its explorers set out across the north, founding new cities in previously uninhabitable lands.

But these foundling cities remained tethered to Eberhar’s industrial might. The city held a near-monopoly on steel production, and it used that leverage to exact steep prices, indifferent to the downstream effects. Tensions rose. Two of the largest satellite cities — [[Tollard]] and [[Valdishal]] — united the region and imposed trade sanctions. The resulting stalemate crippled production on all sides, and forced Eberhar to concede.

In the aftermath, the [[Stålråd]] was established: a national regulatory body created to set fair and sustainable prices for steel. Though at first merely bureaucratic, the Stålråd quickly became something more. Its governance proved efficient. Its principles of logic, balance, and earned autonomy appealed to both old Eberhar and its network of foundling cities. Over time, power flowed into the Stålråd’s hands until it operated as a de facto central government. Few within the culture would call it such, but across the north, the name “Stålråd” came to represent not only the council, but the civilization itself.

That civilization advanced rapidly. Without reliance on magic or divine favor, the [[Stålråd]] developed clean energy, orbital satellites, automated agriculture, cybernetics, and advanced weapons platforms. By the eve of the Last War, it had deployed drones, arc-lances, solar engines, and miniaturized singularity bombs. It was perhaps the most technologically advanced civilization the world had ever seen.

And it rejected magic.

To the Stålrådian mind, [[Magic#Spiritual|Spirit magic]] was the worst kind of surrender — a pact with unknown intelligences, a surrender of human agency. [[Magic#Arcane|Arcane magic]], though rooted in human will, was little better: it allowed individuals to rise far above their peers by accident of aptitude, a system antithetical to the Stålrådian ideals of earned merit, collective advancement, and individual autonomy. This growing disdain was codified into law as the [[Anathema Doctrine]], which criminalized all forms of magic and ordered the expulsion or neutralization of magical practitioners from Stålråd territory.

The [[Urzithan Concordat]], a powerful religious-arcane dominion to the south, viewed the Stålråd’s stance with growing alarm. The Concordat’s entire civilization was built upon communion with the divine and mastery of the arcane — not merely as tools, but as sacred truths. The declaration of the [[Anathema Doctrine]], paired with the Stålråd’s expanding influence, was seen as a threat to the very foundations of Urzithan belief.

Tensions deepened over years. Borders hardened. Trade faltered. Missions failed to return. Whether war was declared, or simply began, is a matter of history lost in ash — but its arrival felt inevitable.
### The Last War
What began as political friction erupted — slowly, then all at once — into an existential conflict. **[[The Last War]]**.

The [[Stålråd]] unleashed the full weight of its ingenuity: orbital strikes, arc-lances, nano-plague delivery drones, and singularity bombs. Entire regions were algorithmically mapped, targeted, and erased. In return, the [[Urzithan Concordat]] answered with godflame prayers that turned battalions to ash, teleporting assassins who stepped through folded space to strike at command nexuses, undead war-beasts stitched from titanic bones, and stormcallers whose chants pulled lightning from the sky.

At its height, the war bent reality itself — twisted by impossible machines and unrelenting sorcery alike. Maps became useless. Time stuttered in the wreckage. Neither side could retreat. Neither side would yield.

The war burned hot and long. And in the end, neither side survived.

The Stålråd collapsed — its command lattice shattered, its reactors went dark, and its cities fell silent. Across the [[Bongire Taiga]], its machine-cities lie broken and lifeless, scavenged by the desperate and feared by the wise.
### Legacy
The [[Stålråd]] was not merely a machine-state. It was a dream: of a world where knowledge set all people free, where no one bowed to gods or kings, and where reason could build something better. In a land shaped by miracles and monsters, the Stålråd stood apart — fatally idealistic, neurotically determined, but deeply human.

Across the [[Shattered Expanse]] and [[Bongire Taiga]], their [[Warforged|war-machines]] still roam — some following orders no longer relevant, others simply broken in mind and purpose. [[Screamer|Screamers]], cheap warforged infantry with human brains barely shielded from sensation, sprint through the dust in search of anything to distract them from their endless pain. The [[Colossus|Colossi]], towering warforged [[Host|Hosts]] too vast to maintain, chose to bury themselves deep in the earth, whispering down into the bedrock to escape the guilt of their deeds.

Weather engines, untethered from any network, continue to shape microclimates with eerie precision: square miles of snowfall under a summer sun, static-choked thunderstorms that never end, winds that reverse by the hour. [[Cryogenic Capsule]]s still lie buried, their occupants—generals, saboteurs, tacticians—awaiting a war that ended long ago.

Then there are the caches: supply bunkers sealed against time, brimming with arc-lances, mimic mines, nanoblade drones, and things no survivor truly understands. These armories now fuel petty wars and warlord empires.

Worse still, the Stålråd’s legacy includes the mutants, ghouls, and engineered hybrids created during the arms race of the Last War—some deliberate, some accidents. Their bloodlines persist in the cracks of the world. There are fabricated plagues, too, that adapt to hosts across generations, and toxins that no longer match the genomes they were made to kill.

Their knowledge survives in fragments, etched into machines that no longer speak their language. And scattered among the ruins are the last of their sleeper cells, encrypted archives, and half-finished gods of steel, waiting in silence.
