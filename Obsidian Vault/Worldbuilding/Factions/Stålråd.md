The ancient city-state of [[Eberhar]] was settled by travelers from the [[Northern Plateau]] adjacent to a section of the [[Romsdal Mountains]] rich with easily accessible mineral deposits of iron and copper. The [[Bongire Taiga]] podzol soil, however, was acidic and nutrient-poor, and the persistent cold weather made sustainable crop growth difficult. Eberhar was forced to rely on its metallurgy to prosper, and so began to develop a metal-focused production industry at an unusually rapid pace. In time, Eberhar compensated for its agricultural disadvantages with mass-produced tools, efficient machinery, and clever logistics.

Driven by necessity and isolated from the religious traditions that defined much of the post-apocalyptic world, Eberhar evolved into a society that placed absolute faith in engineering, innovation, and control over the physical world. Early on, it deployed geothermal pumps, solar-heated greenhouses, and arc furnaces. These developments soon gave way to mechanized agriculture, nuclear reactors, and automated infrastructure. By the time most other powers were still recovering from the ruins of the old world, Eberhar was founding research institutes, launching satellites, and constructing machines that could self-replicate under programmed constraints.

The city prospered, and its explorers set off to found settlements in lands previously too difficult to manage. With continued assistance from Eberhar, these foundling cities thrived — until they didn’t. Eberhar’s functional monopoly on steel and precision-grade alloys allowed them to set prices at the highest value the market could bear, with little regard for the knock-on effects that had on the ability of the foundling cities to sustain their own economies.

Eventually, these economic pressures imploded. Two of the most powerful foundling cities, [[Tollard]] and [[Valdishal]], rallied the region together to enact trade sanctions against Eberhar. The stalemate that followed crippled their collective productive capacity, and Eberhar was forced to relent. In so doing, it was made to institute the Stålråd, a national regulatory body responsible for setting fair, sustainable prices for steel.

The Stålråd remained a limited bureaucratic institution for decades, but increasingly, Eberhar and its foundling citizens began to recognize it as a core part of their cultural identity. The Stålråd's significance rapidly outshone its original purpose, and its name entered the common lexicon as a term for the pseudo-nation as a whole. The Stålrådian people saw the effectiveness of market regulation — and the triumph of engineered order over mystical chaos — and gave more and more power to the Stålråd ruling body, until it became something remarkably similar to a central ruling government... though few Stålrådians would admit to such a thing.

By the time of [[the Last War]], the Stålråd had become the most technologically advanced society in the known world. While other civilizations turned to [[Magic#Arcane|arcane]] pacts or ancient relics, the Stålråd placed its faith in the unyielding certainty of machinery and science. It fielded autonomous drones, arc-throwers, precision railguns, and synthetic infantry. It drew energy from clean fission cores and solar arrays that crowned the Romsdal ridgelines. At its rumored peak, it deployed miniature black hole generators — self-contained singularities used to power or destroy, depending on the need.
## The Last War
The Stålråd's relentless pursuit of mastery over the world brought it into direct conflict with the only force that could match its ambition: the [[Urzithan Concordat]] — a vast, religious-arcane dominion fueled by divine will, necrotic pacts, and artifacts of impossible origin. What began as political tension ignited into an existential war. [[The Last War]].

The Stålråd unleashed drones, arc-lances, satellite bombardments, and singularity bombs. The Concordat answered with godflame prayers that turned engines to slag, teleporting assassins who cut commanders down mid-sentence, and undead siege-beasts clad in relic armor. Their prophets opened the skies and rained blood and fire; their warpriests shattered canyons with chants that bent space. Across countless battlefields, rational precision clashed with divine wrath — and both broke.

The war burned hotter than either side could sustain. And in the end, they fell together.

The Stålråd collapsed — its command systems shattered, its reactors failed, its once-thriving machine cities now lie cracked and lifeless across the Shattered Expanse. The Concordat, too, broke beneath the cost of its victory. Its priest-kings dead or scattered, its armies in retreat, its temples drowned in ash.

The Stålråd were a culture that saw the world as something to be mastered. In a land shaped by miracles and monsters, it stood alone, calculating and magnificent.

Now, only ruins remain — humming, quiet, and dangerous still.
