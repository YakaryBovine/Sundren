Lamensyat, the Prince of Hidden Meaning in Dance, is a [[Fey]] lord associated with deception, performance, and the layered language of movement. Like all Fey, Lamensyat feeds on mistruths, but their domain is the subtle deceit embedded in gesture, rhythm, and expression. They are man and woman simultaneously, embodying in themselves the duality of gendered dance.

Fancy and regal, Lamensyat moves with the elegant determination of a trained dancer. They are at times generous, grandly rewarding their followers for offerings of subtle dance, and at times cruel, reacting to disappointment with complete abandonment.

They reside in their [[Spirit World]] domain, the [[Ballroom]], where the dance never end and time flows according to rhythm rather than order. Those who offer Lamensyat the grandest, most deceptive dances are invited into the Ballroom to dance in a gallery of eternal performers until their [[Soul]]s unravel.

Lamensyat is currently the patron deity of [[Zalummat-Nad√ªrugal]], and is largely responsible for its continued existence - as well their slavish devotion to the art of dance.
