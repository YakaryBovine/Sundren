Modern [[Urzithan Concordat|Urzithan]] theology holds that there are only three [[God|Gods]] of any particular import; these three form the [[Triumvirate]], the spiritual and cultural pillars of their society. But there exists a fourth, just as powerful as the rest and brother to them all; Skofnildr. 

He is the secret God of the [[Stålråd]], lord of Rejecting Divinity for Mundane Trinkets. He exists in derision of the other Gods and is derided by them all; he is the Stålråd refusal to bow to the heavens, despite himself being of the heavens. The Urzithans reject his existence and the Stålråd have never discovered it. Veld concerns himself with neither fact; he has long been content to play alone with his toys in his clockwork realm.
## Appearance
Depictions of Skofnildr are few and far between, but these few renditions of him tend to depict him as a four meter assemblage of disparate mundane technologies holding together in the shape of a man, draped in a plain brown fabric coat. His upper face is that of a simplistic screen, from which springs forth a magnificent snowy beard filled with an infinite array of amusing trinkets. His voice alternates between that of a kindly old man deep in his personal hobbies to a blend of machine error logs, the murmur of algorithmic reasoning, and autogenerated alert text. When he sighs, he exhales a wave of dry, warm furnace air.
