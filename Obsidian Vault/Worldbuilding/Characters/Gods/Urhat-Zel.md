(a.k.a. He Who Rebuilds the Broken)

>A heavy-browed, thick-limbed proto-human stumbles through the forest, clutching helplessly at her chest, trying desperately to pull the pain out. She made the wrong choice, ate the wrong berry, and now she suffers. The berry's toxins run rampant through her nervous system, and soon she is paralyzed. In her mind, her blood is filed with boiling oil and her skin is torn from her flesh. She hopes that a wolf will arrive to tear out her throat. She tries to beg for death, but her species hasn't yet learned the words. It doesn't matter. In that moment, Urhat-Zel is born, stepping forth from unreality to grip the girl's throat. She dies staring into into the eyes of a crying God, and is granted relief. 

Urhat-Zel is the Urzithan God of mercy, transformation through suffering, and the renewal of the self through pain or absolution. They are worshiped as the patron of defenders, martyrs, reformers, and those who have fallen from grace but strive to rise again. They walk beside the dying, kneel with the condemned, and linger in prisons and execution grounds, listening for the moment when guilt turns to growth.

While their name is spoken in courts of law and prisons, they are equally revered in battlefields and sickbeds. Their mercy is not comfort—it is challenge. Mercy, to Urhat-Zel, is the offer of a harder road: to become better than what suffering has made you.
## Appearance and myth
Urhat-Zel appears in myths as a battered, proto-human figure with countless scars, often weeping openly or bearing the injuries of others. In one of his most sacred tales, he is born from the death of a woman who consumed poison berries, too early in history to have language to call for help. In her pain and silence, Urhat-Zel steps forth, crying, and eases her into death. He is born not of cruelty, but of suffering unanswered.

His physical form changes depending on the tale—sometimes bearing the chains of criminals, sometimes the robes of judges, but always with sorrow in his eyes.
## Symbolism
Urhat-Zel is most commonly represented by a mortar and pestle, mid-action, with blood spilling from the crushed contents. This image captures the core belief of Urhat-Zel’s doctrine: that suffering is not an end, but a grinding process that refines the soul. The mortar is the world, the pestle is divine mercy, and the blood — pain, confession, penance — is the cost of transformation.

To followers, this symbol is not gruesome but sacred. The act of being broken down is holy, because only through it can one become something new, something righteous. Priests of Urhat-Zel often wear pendants of this symbol, and penitents tattoo simplified versions on their skin during rites of atonement.
### Worship by the Urzithan Concordat

#### The upper classes
Among nobles and theocratic elites, Urhat-Zel is a symbol of stoic endurance and the rightful outcome of justice. They are prayed to by kings and governors to temper the rage of mobs, to redeem rebels, or to justify harsh punishments as righteous trials. His merciful aspects are largely seen as divine policy, not personal guidance—something that happens to others, not to oneself.

Many powerful Urzithans invoke Urhat-Zel not in penitence, but to ask that his victims be granted peace after punishment has been served. It is said that Urhat-Zel loathes the ruling class, but shows them mercy in the hopes they might change. To this day, they have not.
#### The lower classes
To the downtrodden, Urhat-Zel is beloved. They are prayed to for strength in the face of torment, to shield the spirit from despair, and to turn pain into strength. His worship surges in times of famine, war, and tyranny. For many, Urhat-Zel is the only god who listens.

In desperate times, it is said that he whispers to the broken: “You may become more than this.” And sometimes, very rarely, he answers those who rise up against injustice—not to grant them victory, but to ensure they at least die with purpose.

It is whispered that Urhat-Zel was responsible for the first rebellion that birthed the Concordat, and that their relative quietude in the centuries since is not absence, but disappointment.
