Khalumet, the genderless God of Unity Against the Outsider, embodies the collective will of the Urzithan people, the unquantifiable unifying force that binds their society in common cause.

They are the God of communal strength, invoked by settlements defending themselves against desert raiders, fathers praying for strong marriages for their daughters, and soldiers standing shoulder-to-shoulder against [[Fiend|devils]] and demons. In one lens, "Outsider" means chaos, awry arcanity, and evils from beyond.

[[The Last War]] changed Khalumet. The [[St책lr책d]] stood apart not just from the Urzithans, but from the entire world; their rejection of the divine and the power they were able to hold without it rendered them Outsiders beyond any sphere previously conceived, and Khalumet was revolted. Mere unity would not be enough to meet this existential threat. To survive, Urzit would have to become one. Khalumet withdrew within, and became the God of Monoculture. In Khalumet's name, the devout would bleed the self to feed the whole. 

Once equal among the [[Triumvirate]], Khalumet rose to unquestioned supremacy during the War, representing the purism of the Urzit people and the putrid degeneracy of the St책lr책d. By the end, their siblings had left them, too pained to carry forth Khalumet's xenophobic agenda.
## Symbolism
Khalumet is symbolized by six concentric circles, usually in an alternating gold and bronze pattern, and sometimes with a black smudge around the outermost circle. The smudge never penetrates within the circle. The circles represent unity and cohesiveness, while the smudge represents the Outsider.
