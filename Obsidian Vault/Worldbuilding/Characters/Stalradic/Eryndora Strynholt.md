Eryndora Strynholt was a polymathic inventor active during [[The Last War]]. Her work spanned a range of technical fields primarily pertaining to transhumanism, from cybernetic augmentation and cloning protocols to new genetic templates. A remarkably competent military strategist, her leadership in the war popularized the [[St책lr책d]] military doctrine of invention-as-strategy, which sought to solve the problem of war through new technology over the careful application of force.

Strynholt perished in the early stages of the War, assassinated in her sleep by an [[Urzithan Concordat|Urzithan]] sleeper agent. Her personal legacy positioned her as the perfect St책lr책dian - an inventor, strategist, wife, mother, and servant of the people. The legacy of her technical contributions stood even taller, as her scientific successors advanced her technology and approach to war to such heights that it would scar the world.
