> The Last Place Many See Whole
## History
Hospice is a rare beacon of stability in the wastes of the [[Shattered Expanse]], rising like a solemn wound from the cracked stone where desert and desolation meet. Built upon the shattered bones of the [[House of Life]], an ancient and once-celebrated temple to [[Ashur-Namta]], it now serves a darker, stranger purpose. While the House of Life was once a place of healing and hope for the city-states of the old world, Hospice is a place of transactions, thresholds, and transformation.

Its new custodians are the [[Vurum-Khal]]—the Flesh-Burdened—immortal Priests infected with the sacred Disease of Abundance, a divine affliction that grants eternal durability and monstrous longevity at the cost of terrible pain, decay, and inability to heal. Swathed in ceremonial bandages to keep their blessing from spreading, the Vurum-Khal do not hunger, do not sleep, and do not rot—but they _do lose_ pieces of themselves, inch by inch, over the long centuries. Their settlement exists to replace what they lose, and to venerate their [[God]] through the art of survival in suffering.

In the age of the [[The Dredge|Dredge]], Hospice is known as a place of unexpected peace. Though feared and reviled in equal measure, the Vurum-Khal enforce a sacred neutrality under the purview of Ashur-Namta, and even warbands and slavers hesitate to shed blood within sight of their withered banners. Here, traders barter limbs like coin, exchanging healthy flesh, cybernetic relics, and magical prosthetics for the Vurum-Khal's generous compensation.

Hospice's name comes not from its comfort, but its service to the dying. The Vurum-Khal will pay handsomely for fresh corpses, particularly those not yet claimed by the decay of the wasteland. The limbs of the recently dead are holy prizes, unspoiled offerings in a world of scarcity, grafted to replace what time has stripped away. Some dying pilgrims come willingly, offering their bodies as tribute in exchange for their families’ futures—or in hopes that a part of them might walk forever in sacred service.

The Vurum-Khal rarely induct outsiders, and only those who show unflinching devotion to Ashur-Namta—those who truly believe that abundance must be earned through suffering, and that the body is a tool to be reshaped, broken, and repurposed. Most die in the attempt. Those who survive are never quite human again.

Hospice is not a kingdom, nor a church. It is a reliquary of survival, where life is harvested, grief is currency, and the line between sanctity and horror has long since dissolved.
## Architecture and layout
Hospice clings to the ragged cliffs and broken stone where the Great Desert meets the jagged skin of the Shattered Expanse. From afar, it looks like a ruin resurrected halfway—half-carved, half-collapsed, a jumble of ancient bones and makeshift scaffolding. Yet up close, there’s an eerie sense of order. Hospice is a place of purpose.
### The Womb
At the heart of Hospice stands the Womb, the remnants of the House of Life—a cracked dome of obsidian glass and bleached sandstone, veined with rebar and scorched bronze. Once a temple-hospital, it has become the sanctum and laboratory of the Vurum-Khal. It smells of antiseptic ash and incense made from boiled aloe and embalming resins. Inside, its walls are lined with niches, each bearing the suspended limbs of the dead, wrapped like relics in silk and labeled in ink.

The Collectors themselves rarely leave the Womb unless they are trading or watching a grafting ritual. Beneath the Womb lies the Gutter-Sanctum, a surgically sterile catacomb where the most sacred procedures take place. Visitors are never allowed below.
### The Fringe Market
Surrounding the Womb is the Fringe, a tent-city grown semi-permanent. Tarp shelters, rusted shacks, and repurposed freight crates have been woven into alleys and narrow trade corridors. The air is full of clamor—traders hawking limb-harvesting tools, alchemists selling flesh-preserving tinctures, and fortune tellers claiming to know the moment of your death. Around 300 to 400 people live here at any one time: scavengers, mercenaries, surgeons-for-hire, bone-setters, and desperate pilgrims.

Hospice enforces strict rules: no weapons drawn, no theft, and no violence under the God’s eye. Enforcement rarely requires more than a Collector slowly turning their gaze on you.
### The Offering Skin
A vast plaza of smooth, blackened concrete, known as The Offering Skin, lies before the Womb. Traders bring goods here—corpses on litters, mechanical arms sealed in lead boxes, mana-stained artifacts still leaking arc-light—and lay them out for appraisal. The Collectors emerge silently, sometimes alone, sometimes in pairs, moving with slow precision to inspect the offerings. Payment is always exact, always generous, and always final.
## The Bloomcradle
Nearby is the Bloomcradle, a sacred garden where the Collectors attempt to cultivate rare plant life—mutant herbs, fungi that eat metal, and the legendary Saltflowers, said to bloom only in soil salted by tears.
## Atmosphere
Hospice is reverently quiet. Conversations are held in hushed tones. Even the market seems to pulse more than shout. The air is hot, dry, and smells faintly of medicinal herbs and scorched sand. At night, low chanting can be heard from the Womb, the sound carried on still air like a heartbeat made of stone and memory.

At sunset, a ritual torch is lit atop the dome of the Womb. Its smoke is green, smelling faintly of marigold and burning sugar. That’s when traders make their final offers for the day—sunset is sacred, when the God of Abundance watches most closely.
