>"Look to the skies", bellowed the High Prophet, "and bear witness to the truth we have known all along: the Gods never abandoned us." An immense pillar of divine fire plummeted forth from the Sunlancer, and Forsyning was no more. "But they did abandon them".

At the height of the Last War, the [[Urzithan Concordat]] forged the Sunlancer, a gargantuan golden sphere that hung menacingly in low atmosphere above the world. The Sunlancer was blessed with the power of [[Khalumet]], representing the sum total of their hatred of the [[Stålråd]]. The Sunlancer was able to absorb the raw divine energy that radiated outward from the heavens. After a one week charging period, it would fire an immense pillar of cleansing fire from its [[Khalumet#Symbolism|concentric-circle]] emblazoned face at a prayer-designated location on the surface of the world, assuredly obliterating any life in its target radius.

Two [[Stålråd]] cities and one key fortified supply depot, [[Forsyning]], fell to the Sunlancer before the Stålråd were able to retaliate. By then, the Urzithans firmly believed that their victory was assured. In their hubris, they failed to realize that the Sunlancer was vulnerable to aerial assault for a short time directly following its energy expulsion. The Stålråd assailed the orbital structure with zeppelins and clockwork Dragons, and despite high casualties, were able to destroy a large section of the Sunlancer. With the device so badly damaged, it became incapable of receiving prayers and began absorbing divine energy at a lower rate. It defaulted to the instructions last given to it, and for the remainder of the War, it brought the inordinate wrath of Khalumet down upon the already ruined Forsyning once a month.

With the War over and the Dredge begun, the Sunlancer continues its pointless and hellaciously destructive cycle. Now, however, Forsyning lies buried underneath several layers of compact dirt maintained by tenacious [[Elemental|Elementals]]. Its lower complexes still house mostly in-tact ancient treasures, but the depot is entirely inaccessible. Inaccessible, that is, barring one day every few months, on which the earth is torn asunder, gracing suicidally brave adventurers with two three to brave the sunken ruins and retrieve its treasures before the world fills in above them.
