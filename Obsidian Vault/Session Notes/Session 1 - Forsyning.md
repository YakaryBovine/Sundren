> As the first session of the game, the premise was pre-established by the Game Master and communicated to the players in advance. After this, players will have more autonomy in deciding what risks to take next. 

**Premise**
Every few months, the [[Sunlancer]], a great golden sphere hovering above the [[Shattered Expanse]], finishes gathering a pool of prayer energy and unleashes it as an immense pillar of divine flames against a particular spot on the ground. In doing so, it opens up the entrance to [[Forsyning]], an ancient [[Stålråd]] supply depot.

The party has heard of this occurrence through rumours and legend, and have arrived at the soon-to-be-entrance to the depot, ready to dive in and plunder its riches.

**Events**
1. The party gathers far from the rim of where they expect the Sunlancer to fire. Some distance away along the same rim, [[Koom'durg|a trio of Earth Elementals]] and a group of rainbow-sheathed robed figures stand in two separate groups. The party makes no move to approach them.
2. The Sunlancer fires, boring a deep, hot hole through the ground. The Earth Elementals surf the earth through the resulting magmatic tunnel, while the robed figures vanish in a poof of purple energy.
3. The party waits for the tunnel to cool, then descends downwards. They are followed by hordes of sentient earth that have dislodged themselves from the nearby mountains to fill in the hole. They know it will take about a day for this to happen, but only three hours for them to have substantial difficulty getting back out.
4. The party finds the entrance to Forsyning at the bottom of the tunnel. They enter depot D, noting the existences of depots A, B, C, and E.
5. Within the depot, they are confronted by turrets and extreme heat.
6. The party progresses through the depot, first coming into an office room full of [[Screamer|Screamers]]. They wipe them out and access the consoles they were working on.
	1. The first computer shows an ASCII-based interface for a climate management system.
	2. The second computer details threats to the supply depot. All visible logs are obsessively focused on an entity named [[Furls-His-Wings]], which has supposedly been assaulting the depot for years. The officer writing the log thinks they can fire a nuclear weapon from Forsyning A to deal with it, but thinks they will need [[Deep State]] level access to get in.
	3. The third computer has exceeded its storage capacity and now show only the latest logs, which consist of combinations of "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", and "DIE". Most of these commands were accepted, but "DIE" is responded to with "Command not recognized". After some time, the terminal seems to have been locked down, now responding only with "Caretaker access required".
7. The party comes upon a room full of active mainframes, which they cannot interact with due to a lack of skill with [[Stålråd]] technology.
8. They then find the climate control system, which they then activate from the terminal office room terminal after having some difficulty mastering the interface.
9. They progress forward, coming to a bridge spanning over a lava river, being swept by another [[Screamer]]. [[Mahana nō Kaihanu]] tries to shoot the Screamer from afar, but is interrupted by another laser turret locking on from across the bridge.
10. The party moves back to the office space and removes the pile of Screamer bodies from the corner, revealing another way into the lava river. [[Gizdubar]] and Mahana sneak around the extremely precarious rim of the river. Mahana nearly falls to her death, but [[Finnegan]] catches her with a hasty use of [[Elemental Favor]]. After getting through, the pair are able to the other side of the bridge and behind the laser turrets, and Mahana takes out both turrets and the janitor with arrows from the shadows.
11. The janitor had an insertable drive for "caretaker access" on it, so the party returns to the office space and uses the computer which required it. Gizdubar tries many combinations of "shut down", but none of them work. He then tries "up", which is accepted, but it's not clear what it does.
12. Moving on, the party comes to a room with some intact, seemingly unopened containers - and rows and rows of pods containing [[Host|Hosts]]. One of them is in the midst of waking up...
