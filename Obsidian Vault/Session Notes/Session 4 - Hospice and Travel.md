**Events**
1. The party buys a bunch of supplies from [[Hospice]] using the silver they found in [[Forsyning]]. They also buy [[Bill]], a [[Gallipede]] pack companion.
2. They set out with [[Barnoldus]] and [[Grin]] towards the latter's town. They plan to defend it from the impending [[Screamer]] force should such a task appear achievable and profitable.
3. [[Akira]] and [[Gilgamesh]] interrogate [[Sabit]] about the [[Zid-Nam-Tul]], and are told that it is likely associated with [[Urhat-Zel]]. Akira prays to Urhat-Zel, and discovers the purpose of the sword: to deliver mercy and repentance to evildoers.
4. The party asks Grin some questions about his town and find the answers to be unsatisfactory and suspicious, but press him no further.
5. The party's journey is long but uneventful, until the final night of travel where they are attacked in their sleep by a skeletal [[Necromancer]]. The Necromancer unleashes a blizzard around the camp from far away; [[Lilith]] sees the Necromancer's piercing blue eyes, having stayed awake all night, but does not recognize them for what they are.
6. The rest of the party awakes. The Necromancer's skeletal minions begin pouring out from the blizzard. The party fights back, but each skeleton they damage is repaired anew after being sucked back into the blizzard.
7. Gilgamesh, realizing what's happening, grabs hold of one of the skeleton's torsos after breaking it, preventing it from reforming.
8. Lilith calls forth her necromantic powers and seizes control of two of the skeletons (now named Lyle and Kyle), and permanently annihilates several of the rest.
9. With the reprieve in combat, Gilgamesh and [[Sarra]] push forward into the blizzard towards the blue lights, and discover the skeletal Necromancer for the first time.
10. Akira stays behind to protect Lilith, Sabit, and Bill.
11. Gilgamesh and Sarra destroy the skeletal Necromancer, ending the blizzard and the reanimation of the skeletons. Akira and Lilith finish off the remaining skeletons.
12. The party loot the skeletal Necromancers body. They find a copy of the [[Urzithan-Stålråd Terms of Surrender]], a tattered arcane scroll, and two bright blue sapphires embedded in the skeleton's eye sockets. They take the sapphires and the terms of surrender.
13. The party check on Bill and Sabit, and determine they are fine. With Grin's town in sight range, they go back to their tents to salvage what rest they can.
