**Events**
1. The party arrives at [[Zalummat-Nad√ªrugal]] with [[Grin]] and [[Barnoldus]]' crew.
2. They a town in an excellently defensible location, with well fertilized soil right outside their walls on the edge of the Shattered Expanse. The town has no defenses.
3. The party is immensely suspicious about the fertility of their crops and their lack of defence. They press Grin about it, but he tells them nothing. He lets on that there is a building at the top of the town's terrace that is important somehow, but insists that it's nothing.
4. The party break into the building, and find it to be a dance hall with an ornately engraved couple of dancers on the flooring. [[Gilgamesh]] follows the outlines of the dancers in a rhythmic pattern, and is struck with a heart attack by [[Lamensyat]].
5. The party agree to defend the town after a meeting with Grin and Lelsie, the settlement's "Second".
6. They arrange the town's defenses, training their people, setting up rocks to drop from the walls, helping them dig ditches, etc.
7. At night, they venture towards the dance hall and find Grin leaving it with a lit torch. They intimidate - a little - into revealing the purpose of the hall: it is to provide dance worship to their lord Lamensyat, who has abandoned them only recently after a very skilled but uninteresting dancer delivered an unappealing performance.
8. The party convinces Lelsie, apparently the best dancer in the village, to perform one last dance for Lamensyat - at the risk of her own health or life. [[Akira]] teaches her a cultural dance of his people, an origin tale about the founding of his nation on the Sundered continent. Lelsie says she will infuse it with her own take as well.
9. The party finishes preparing the city's defenses. After three days, it is clear that the invading Screamers will arrive soon.
10. [[Lilith]] joins Lelsie in the dance hall, ready to use her necromancy to protect Lelsie from death should Lamensyat lash out at her.
11. The rest of the party join the town's defenses.
