**Events**
1. The defense of [[Zalummat-Nad√ªrugal]] begins. The party decides to stand atop one of the city walls and bait incoming [[Screamer]]s into attacking them while the rest of the town defends themselves below.
2. [[Lilith]] and [[Lelsie]] perform the latter's dance at the town's dance hall in an attempt to appease [[Lamensyat]].

Lelsie is taken into some kind of mirror dimension within the town hall.
