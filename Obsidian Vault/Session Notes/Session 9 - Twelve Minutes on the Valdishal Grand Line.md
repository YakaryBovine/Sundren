With a sudden shock, the party awoke back in their seats as the train set off once again. It seemed the past twelve minutes were doomed to repeat, echoing the despair in the mechanical [[Skofnildr|conductor]]’s voice over the train’s loudspeaker. In order to test the theory, [[Lilith]] asked [[Sarra]] to chop off one of her skeletal fingers, expecting it to return when they loop back around. [[Gilgamesh]] turned to their fellow passengers. Unable to understand their [[Stålråd]] dialect, but convinced that their previous conversations are repeating.

The party sprung into action, [[Akira]] and Gilgamesh headed towards the locomotive hoping to glean some insight from the conductor, while Sarra and Lilith headed down the carriages towards the loud popping sound they heard moments before their fiery, nuclear deaths.

Gilgamesh attempted to open the door to the locomotive but the mechanism responded with a clear “access violation”. Akira tried his hand, bluffing and pretending to be a Stålråd Commander Sven. Luckily the gambit worked and the door opened.

The pair questioned the conductor as to what was going on. The conductor explained that the train became a military asset during the war - refitted with armour and a more powerful engine. However, his explanations were cut short as errors flashed upon his face screen.

> “Pierce the Quantum Veil” - “Beware the slowdown” - “Error 3040”

Confused, Gilgamesh asked the conductor for the train manual - hoping to look up this error code - which is produced for them from the depths of his shaggy white beard.

With his Commander Sven persona, Akira was able to get the conductor to reveal what was at the rear of the train - the nuclear reactor which powers it. Meanwhile, Gilgamesh decided on one final test to confirm their time loop - he used his patented torch throw to throw one of his torches off the train, hoping it would return to him on the next loop.

Down the train, Sarra and Lilith moved through the other passengers as they headed towards the back, their progress delayed as each carriage’s door took precious seconds to open. The delay was significant enough as the carriage started jostling on the tracks before they could find the source. Passengers started screaming and panicking as the train derailed and the reactor exploded again, killing everyone and sending them back to their seats as of twelve minutes ago.

The party awoke back at the start of the loop - Lilith’s finger and Gilgamesh’s torch both returned to them. After a quick update of what each pair discovered, they began to move again. Sarra climbed out a hatch to the top of the train - hoping to spot something significant. However, the jostling of the train and incredible wind speeds made it impossible for the young shapeshifter to keep her grip and she fell from the train, killed as she hit the ground with tremendous force.

Lilith headed to the passageway between carriages to inspect the connection mechanism. She placed the Jade Skull on it, hoping to use it to disconnect the front of the train, however it seemed to be unable to do anything.

Gilgamesh grabbed a nearby passenger by the shoulders, demanding an explanation, but he was unable to understand their panicked Stålråd language.

Akira remembered the words “Beware the slowdown” and headed back to the locomotive, using his Commander Sven personal to open the door and demand the conductor slow the train. This only served to enrage the mechanical man and he grabbed Akira, slamming him against the wall and easily crushing the poor samurai’s bones. Clinging to life, he looked out the front of the train, hoping to see some clue as they neared the end of the loop.

With the loop growing closer, Gilgamesh leaned out the side of the train, looking down its length to figure out exactly which carriage the derailment started at. Unfortunately, he could not maintain his grip on the speeding train and fell. As he is slammed into the ground, he spotted the derailing carriage about one sixth of the way down the train, but is too preoccupied with his grisly death to know exactly which carriage it was as the nuclear explosion takes the train once more.

Another loop began and the party found themselves alive once more in their seats. After a brief discussion, they decided that finding this derailing carriage was the best clue they had, and to split up to cover as much ground as possible.

Akira donned his Commander Sven persona again, opening the door to the locomotive and convinced the mechanical conductor to hit the emergency door open button. All the carriage doors slid open as emergency lighting filled the train, no longer impeding their path as they got into position.

After about ten minutes since the start of the loop, Lilith noticed a blonde Stålråd man rise from his seat in the fifteenth carriage - in contrast to the other passengers who seemed glued to their seats by the apparent emergency. The man pulled a suitcase down from the overhead luggage with a scowl on his face, removing a bottle of pink liquid that he quickly consumed.

The mysterious pink liquid took quick effect, his muscles bulging and gaining mass as he transformed into a grotesque picture of physical strength. In his new found form, the man headed between the carriages and began slamming his fists down on the connection, breaking it after a few swings and derailing the train once again as the reactor exploded.

The party awoke, the knowledge of this aggressive passenger quickly shared as they planned on how to deal with him. Akira with his Commander Sven persona opened the door to the locomotive and pushed past the conductor to slam his hand down on the emergency door open button. Leaving the Jade Skull behind to watch the front of the train.

Lilith and Sarra reached the carriage with the unruly passenger, wasting no time as Lilith used her scroll to cast mind control on the man. With him nullified, Sarra opened his suitcase and took the pink potion.

The party waited as time ticked past the twelve minute mark without event, the danger seemingly thwarted. Gilgamesh took this opportunity to move to the rear carriage, climbing into his power armour as a precaution. On the back wall was the door to the reactor, locked by a numerical keypad that he could not unlock.

Twenty minutes after the start of the time loop, the conductor came over the loudspeaker.

“Prepare for the slowdown.” His voice maintained its grimness.

As the train began to slow, the cyan fog that surrounded it lifted and revealed the outside world to the party. Out the right side was the Wurber Blight, its crystalline blue waters packed with sailboats that appeared to be relics of a past world. In contrast, the left side of the train revealed a bitter war of magic and technology.

Spells rocked against the side of the train but seemed to have little effect until the locomotive exploded spectacularly, derailing and setting off the reactor in yet another nuclear explosion.

As the party awoke into yet another loop, the Jade Skull reported that it saw a circular object on the tracks moments before the locomotive explosion. With yet another hurdle to conquer, the party sprung back to action.

Akira reopened the emergency doors, using his Commander Sven persona to get the keypad combination from the conductor as he did so.

Sarra transformed into her bestial form, running on all fours to the blonde Stålråd man. The man saw her coming and assumed a martial art stance, striking the feral hyena on the snout and stunned her briefly. With this opening, he grabbed Sarra’s front legs, attempting to tear her apart with his bare hands. Luckily, she managed to break free and - with several swift strikes of her claws - she left her foe bleeding out on the carriage floor. Gilgamesh made his way to the back of the train and used the code for the keypad to reach their stashed power core and the train’s reactor.

At the front of the train, Akira and Lilith climbed on top and prepared for the slowdown. As the cyan fog lifted and the ancient war came into view once again, they focused on the tracks ahead and saw a Stålråd man approaching holding the metal circular object that appeared to be some sort of explosive device.

Akira took aim with his new laser rifle, firing off two shots that went wide due to his inexperience with the advanced weapon. Lilith stepped in and prepared her spell of Compel Flesh. As the magics worked their way into the Stålråd man’s mind, she noticed another presence in there and began to wrest control. She managed to push out this foreign influence, letting the train pass him by before he could put the mine on the tracks.

The battle raged on outside the train until Akira spied a wizard on a hill to his left, preparing some manner of terrible spell. He took aim again, both shots once again swung wide and the wizard easily completed the spell. Magics burst forth and arced down at the train, blasting it off the tracks once more. The nuclear fire took them once more.

Awoken again, the party knew exactly what they needed to do.

Akira made for the emergency door button, however this time the gambit failed and he couldn’t get the doors open. This slowed Sarra down as she now needed to open the doors as she worked her way towards the blonde man. However, she managed to arrive before he took his potion and buried her axe in his skull from behind.

With the first hazard dealt with, Akira climbed back on top of the train and readied his laser rifle. The previous loop had helped familiarise him with the weapon and he deftly hit the mine with his first shot, causing its carrier to explode in a shower of gore. The next target came into view - the mage on the hilltop. Akira’s aim was true and the beam burned a hole clean through the ancient mage’s chest.

But the threats to the train were not done. Fifty two minutes past the start of the loop another explosion rocked the back of the train, triggering a chain reaction in the reactor that sent them hurtling back to the beginning of the loop.

The party was sure they had learned of all the threats by now and set their plan into motion once more.

Akira and Lilith headed towards the front of the train, opening the emergency doors and climbing on top to deal with the threats during the slowdown.

Sarra and Gilgamesh made their way towards the back of the train. Sarra quickly dispatched the potion man with a sharp axe blow as they passed him by.

Akira’s laser shot ran true, once again felling the mine carrier but missing the hilltop mage. Luckily Lilith was there and spread her hands as she cast Coruscating Coffin. Necromantic energies surrounded the enemy mage, quickly crushing him as Lilith flicked her wrist.

Sarra and Gilgamesh arrived at the reactor car. Gilgamesh quickly climbed into his power armour - ready for the final threat. Everything seemed quiet until they decided to look through the arcane gems they had previously acquired. The heat of the reactor was apparent through the distorted heat vision the gems provided, but also a hot spot began to grow on the wall of the carriage. The spot began to grow hotter as the metal was cut through from the outside.

Gilgamesh climbed to the top of the carriage and looked over the edge. Perched on the side of the train as if it was solid ground crouched a tall woman - obviously [[Urzithan Concordat|Urzithan]] - in stolen Stålråd garb, one hand held a glowing orb of a spell, while the other was a brilliant flame that was cutting into armoured metal.

The power armoured knight leaned over the side, swinging down at her with his longsword. He missed completely, but the interruption was enough to break her concentration as the spells failed. She fell, quickly clinging to whatever hand hold she could find and swung herself underneath the carriage, hoping to restart her attack.

Gilgamesh easily climbed down the side after her, his power armour having no trouble holding onto the side of the speeding train as he swung again under the train.

His blow missed, but in her attempt to avoid it, the Urzithan woman’s shoulder caught the track zooming under her. Her grip was instantly broken as she fell under the wheels and her body was splattered against the underside of the carriage.

With the threats finally dealt with, the train arrived at Valdishal Station after its hour-long journey which felt like a lifetime for the party on board. They quickly steeled themselves, retrieving their power core from the armoured carriage as their [[Gallipede]]’s - Bill and Ted - were led down back to solid ground. From above the passenger seats dropped some gas masks, which they donned as they deboarded to a lush, verdant and overgrown new land. Floating green particles in the air drifted around them as the gas masks did their job.

Before departing from the station they spoke with the conductor, hoping to get some information about the time loop curse or the distant past they had briefly found themselves in. However his reference was to a date in the Stålråd dating system which they had no frame of reference for. With a final goodbye to the conductor, they finally learned his name - Skofnildr. He seemed grim as he once more boarded the train and back into his living nightmare.

The party left the station behind them, with no real goal on where to go. Hoping to find some clues to what they had experienced or what had happened to their world generations past. Before they could make any sort of plan, three drones appeared in the distance, quickly flying over to them as beams of light swept across the party, turning red as they reached the power core stored in Bill’s saddlebag. The drones departed towards a nearby hill, bringing the parties attention to four figures looming on top of it.

One was seated, some sort of control device in [[Soren Veyndahl|his]] hands. Another held a large rifle to [[Ingrid Skaarvik|their]] shoulder, its sights pointed directly at them. The third was a [[Brynja Kolstad|large woman]] who seemed to be more muscle than anything else. Even from this distance her large stature was apparent. The last one was clearly not human, [[Haldren Vekk|his]] metal body like that of the Warforged [[Screamer|Screamers]] they had previously fought, only far more advanced. His golden robes fluttering as he mounted a board that seemed to defy gravity, riding it down the hill towards the party with the muscular woman steps behind them

With the rifle clearly locked onto them, and intimidating size of the approaching strangers, the party knew there would be no running. They would have to face this new potential threat head on.
