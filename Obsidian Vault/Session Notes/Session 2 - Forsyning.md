[[Mahana nō Kaihanu]], [[Gizdubar]], [[Finnegan]], and [[Goruk]] have just entered a room with rows of pods containing unawakened [[Host]]s. One of them is waking up, and has already begun [[Screamer|screaming]].
1. The party kills the awakened Screamer. This triggers the system's backup caretaker protocol, ejecting another Host from the adjacent pod.
2. Gizdubar charges deep into the room, looking for a way to shut the machinery down. They are dismayed to find that each pod would require individual shutdown.
3. The newly awakened Screamer maintains their sanity for long enough to activate the emergency release, which is intended to awoken all sleeping caretakers. The system is jammed, however, and it only awakens four.
4. The Screamers drive each other even madder with their screaming, leaving those awake unable to press the emergency release again.
5. The party fights valiantly, but with their weaker members deep trapped behind enemy lines, they are all overwhelmed and torn apart by the Screamers.

> [!info] Total party kill
> The adventures of this first party ended here, but the campaign continues on. The players each created new characters, who had also heard of the [[Sunlancer]] and [[Forsyning]] Supply Depot D and were now arriving months after the original party died.

1. [[Gilgamesh]], [[Lilith]], [[Sarra]] and [[Akira]] descend into Supply Depot D. They discover much the same things the original party did, except with many of the dangers resolved.
2. They reach the bridge where a janitor performs its sweeping duties, and kill it from the shadows. They then hear screaming from the room containing the Host pods.
3. Deducing that killing one janitor causes another one to be ejected, the party sends [[Sarra]] to sneak into the pod room, where she nonlethally incapacitates the awoken Screamer. No further janitors awake.
4. The party subtly peers into a room full of severely overgrown sentient [[plants]] that have taken over the entire room with their vegetation. They decide to deal with that later, and close the door.
5. The party enters [[Forsyning]]'s vault, activating its primary defenses: an enormous [[Stålråd]] [[Warforged]] with a revolving rocket launcher and a drill. The session ends.
