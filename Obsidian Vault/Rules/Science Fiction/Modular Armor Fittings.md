In most post-apocalyptic settings, the fittings listed below can only be acquired as salvage from ruins, plunder from defeated foes, or as rewards from wealthy patrons. In a sci-fi setting such as *Stars Without Number*, they might be available on the open market. The table at right gives a typical cost for worlds where they are freely traded. More restricted markets will increase this price.

| Tech Level | Cost to Purchase |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| TL3        | 5,000 credits    |
| TL4        | 20,000 credits   |
| TL5        | N/A              |
## Fitting descriptions
### Ablative Meteor Shielding
Ablative foam and signal mutators are combined with personal-scale grav dampers to allow the user to make stealthy orbital insertions. They can jump from a ship’s airlock or cargo hold to hit within 1d100 meters of a desired target point below. They are invisible to TL3 sensors, and apply a -3 penalty to any TL4 sensor [[Skill Checks|skill checks]] to notice the insertion. The shielding is then inoperable until the next maintenance.
### Aquatic Adaptation Suite
The suit is altered to function in liquid environments, allowing three-dimensional movement at the user’s normal move rate, indefinite breathing time underwater, and immunity to environmental pressure down to roughly 1,000 meters. Integrated optics allow vision out to 90 meters even in the absence of light, and any mounted weapons are modified to function normally underwater.
### Assault Charge Servos
Once per scene, as a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Move action]], move triple your normal move rating. While using it, you can move past melee-armed enemies freely without needing to make a [[Common Combat Actions#Make a Fighting Withdrawal - Main Action|Fighting Withdrawal]].
### Backseat Driver Mod
A built-in autonav unit allows the user to nominate a particular location; if the user is rendered unconscious or incapacitated, the suit will automatically use their actions to move back to the location, navigating most physical obstacles with its built-in expert system. Emergency SOS transmissions and location transmissions can be keyed to allies in this instance, and the suit can be redirected toward a nearby ally if they know its user-set command word.  
The suit can even be triggered to return to a point when it is completely empty, if its user decides to send it back. More than 15 points of damage done to the suit on its way will incapacitate it until the next maintenance cycle.
### Black Ofuda
This jailbreak coprocessor must be permanently integrated with a Tsukumogami Processor in a process that takes one day and a successful Int/Program [[Skill Checks|skill check]] against difficulty 10. On a failure, both are ruined. On a success, the Tsukumogami Processor can now use its [[Action Types#Main Actions|Move action]] to fire suit weapons, take a bonus physical action, or cause the suit to move as with a Move Action.  

The Tsukumogami Processor’s commands to the suit cannot be overridden by the wearer, however, and VIs jailbroken by this fitting often acquire a very strong-willed personality to go with their new freedom. An “empty” suit piloted only by a VI is treated as having 15 hit points plus any Soak it may have, +6 attack bonus, a save of 14+, and a Move of 10m. If hit points are fully depleted, the suit is inoperable until the next maintenance.
### Brainguard Cap
The suit automatically alerts its wearer when they are targeted by a telepathic effect, though the source is not indicated. Any Mental saves against psychic powers can be rolled twice, and the better one taken. This fitting does not function for a psychic wearer.
### Breacher Fist
As a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Main Action]], an arm-mounted demo unit allows the wearer to blast a human-sized hole in an adjacent wall up to one meter thick, provided it’s not made of TL4 military fortification material or the like. The fist is too unwieldy to serve as a weapon against mobile targets, but if used against an immobile person, object, or vehicle it does damage as a demo charge.
### Camo Skin, Advanced
As Basic Camo Skin, but the chromatic projectors are much more precise and fluid in their cloaking. The +2 bonus applies to any Stealth check at any range.
### Camo Skin, Basic
As an On Turn action, the suit can change its coloration to blend in with its surroundings. Stealth checks are granted a +2 bonus provided no potential observer is closer than 20 meters.
### Choke Cloud Sprayer
As a Move action, the user can activate a surface-mounted tear gas grenade or other toxic gas grenade, affecting all targets within normal grenade burst range — and the user himself if he doesn’t have sealed systems active. This fitting can be triggered as often as the user has Readied gas grenades available.
### Comm Suite, Advanced
Advanced comm tech provides the benefits of a basic suite, but increases the range to 50 kilometers. Transmissions between the suit and other TL4 comm units are automatically encrypted, and cannot normally be cracked quickly enough to be useful during a given encounter. TL3 communications tech cannot even detect these transmissions.
### Comm Suite, Basic
A helmet-mounted radio and heads-up display allow for free communication with others within short-range radio distance of 2 kilometers or so. The suit can transmit and receive video data on command.
### Deployable Force Shield
As a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Move action]], the user can throw down a translucent force shield within 3 meters. The shield is 3m x 3m in size, must have at least one edge resting on the ground, and counts as hard cover. It has 20 hit points but only heavy weapons can damage it quickly enough to matter in a fight. It lasts for the rest of the scene, until deactivated as an On Turn action, or until the user uses this fitting again.  
If the shield is deployed more than once in a scene, roll 1d6 before it’s deployed; on a 5+, the fitting is drained for the rest of the scene and does not trigger.
### Drone Mount
This mount allows a single man-portable drone supplied by the user to be affixed to the suit with ten minutes of work. The suit user can operate the drone out to its usual range, but gains a bonus [[Action Types#Main Actions|Move action]] each round that can only be used to command the drone. If this fitting is taken more than once, each mount grants its own Main Action bonus for its drone only.
### ECM Projector
When activated as an On Turn action, broad-spectrum electronic countermeasures eliminate any non-allied TL3 or lower radio communication or remote control within a 300 meter radius. The projector can be run for up to 30 minutes before requiring an equal amount of time to recalibrate.
### Efficiency Core, Advanced
The suit runs for 8 hours on a single Type B power cell. The cell is ruined by the discharge process.
### Efficiency Core, Basic
The suit runs for two hours on a single Type B power cell. The cell is ruined by the discharge process.
### Efficiency Core, Pretech
The suit runs for 24 hours on a single Type B power cell. The cell is ruined by the discharge process.
### Efficiency Core, Restricted Directorate
A vanishingly rare component, the suit will run indefinitely without a power cell and requires maintenance only once a month.
### Emergency Power Cell
A supplementary Type B power cell can be loaded into the suit to automatically take over if the main cell runs out of power. It powers the suit for its usual runtime, but is destroyed in the process.
### Exoskeletal Boost, Advanced
As Basic Exoskeletal Boost, but their effective Strength modifier is +3, and all of their Stowed Encumbrance can be used as if it was Readied.
### Exoskeletal Boost, Basic
While wearing the armor, the user’s effective Strength score is 18 for purposes of Encumbrance or ability modifiers.
### Exoskeletal Boost, Pretech
As Advanced Exoskeletal Boost, but their effective Strength is 22 for Encumbrance purposes and they can lift, bend, or break any unarmored object no larger than a compact car as a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Move action]].
### Finger of Death
As a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Move action]], the user can target an organic subject within 10 meters with an invisible beam of high-energy radiation. The emitter is subtle, and only someone familiar with this fitting would recognize its use.  
If the user hits with the beam, the target will receive a lethal dose of radiation. In the absence of TL4 medical attention or radiation shielding equal to a vacc suit or better, the target will die within 48 hours after exhibiting the signs of radiation poisoning.  
Each time this fitting is used, roll 1d6; on a 1, the user is exposed as well, despite any anti-rad fittings the suit may have.
### Floodlights
The suit is equipped with brilliantly bright floodlights that can clearly illuminate an area up to 30m around the suit or 50 meters directly in front of it. Attackers suffer a -2 penalty to hit the user while the lights are engaged unless they have protection against glare. The floodlights can run as long as the suit has power.
### Ghost Walker Field
As an On Turn action, the user becomes invisible and inaudible to unaided senses and typical TL4 sensors. If someone knows their general location, melee attacks can be made against them at -4 to hit, but ranged attacks are futile.  
The field is fragile and will break if the user runs, attacks, or makes other sharp motions; psychic ability use also disrupts the circuits. The field lasts up to 15 minutes, but requires a 15 minute recharge period after it drops.
### Gravitic Flight Struts
Miniaturized grav units allow the user to fly at their normal movement rate. This flight can be used freely for up to fifteen minutes, but it takes fifteen minutes of downtime for the capacitors to recharge after the use ends.
### Gravitic Fold Flight
Pretech distortion generators allow the user to fly freely at twice their normal movement rate. This flight may be used indefinitely.
### Hydraulic Jump Dampers
The user ignores the first hundred meters of fall damage and always lands on their feet.
### Identification Lock
The suit is programmed with a user restriction, making it inoperable to anyone not on its whitelist. Resetting the lock is an Int/Fix or Int/Program skill check against difficulty 12 that takes one day. Unauthorized uninstallation requires an Int/Fix skill check against difficulty 12; failure slags the suit.
### Integral Ripper Bar
A chainsaw-like suit attachment allows the user to cut a man-sized hole in any non-metallic, non-fortified barrier as a Main Action. If used as a weapon, it uses Str/Dex as attributes, does 3d6 damage, Shock of 2/18, and a d8/x4 Trauma Rating. As it is unwieldy, however, it applies a -3 penalty to hit.
### Integrated Ammo Feed
The suit can be loaded with up to 10 Encumbrance of physical ammunition and will load it into any Readied weapon the user wields as an On Turn action. This fitting can be installed more than once.
### Jump Jets
Short-range thrusters allow the user to leap up to 30 meters horizontally or vertically as a Move action. Falls of 30 meters or less are ignored. This fitting cannot be used on two consecutive rounds.
### Kinetic Rebuke Shielding
When attacked by someone within 5 meters, a counterburst of high-energy particles strikes them for 3d8 damage before their attack is resolved, with an Evasion save for half. This shielding can trigger only once per round.
### Linked Targeting System
A specific weapon mount is associated with this fitting, and can be changed at each maintenance cycle. Whenever the user makes an attack with another weapon, they may also attack with this weapon, targeting the same or a different target. This fitting may be installed more than once, but each one after the first adds a cumulative +1 Mass and Power to the cost.
### Multispectral Optics
Full-color vision and a thermal overlay is possible out to normal sight range, regardless of smoke, mist, or darkness.
### Neural Buffer
This sophisticated pretech fitting is usable only by psychics. When installed, it grants 2 bonus points of Effort that only recover once per 24 hours, even if a power used would normally return them after a scene or after a durational power is ended.
### Night Vision Sensors
Basic monochrome night vision is enabled out to one hundred meters.
### Onboard Medical Unit
Up to a dozen doses of pharmaceuticals can be loaded into this unit and administered as an On Turn action by the wearer, either to himself or to an adjacent ally. Only one dose can be applied per round, and the onboard computer has a functional Heal-1 skill if the user’s isn’t higher. The unit counts as a medkit for relevant needs.
### Pathfinder Bridging System
A compact extensible bridging unit may be deployed adjacent to the suit as an On Turn action. The unit can extend up to 20 meters and is one meter wide; it can function as a bridge capable of carrying the weight of a dozen modular suits at once or as a ladder. Adhesion pads at either end make it impossible to knock away unless 15 points of damage are done to it, or 30 points to break the bridge itself. The bridge can be reclaimed with five minutes of work. If not recovered, this fitting is unusable until after the next maintenance.
### Plague Wind Generator
As a Main Action, the user triggers a cloud of nerve gas in a 5-meter radius around them. All air-breathing subjects within that range take 6d6 damage, with a save for half—this includes the user, if their suit does not have sealed systems. This system can only be triggered once between maintenance cycles.
### Plating Optimization
This fitting decreases plating AC by 2 and halves Soak, rounded up, but decreases the Mass and Power requirements of the other fittings on the suit. It has no effect on suits without plating.
### Plating, Advanced
Grants the user AC 20, Soak 25, +2 Trauma Target, and immunity to Shock. They cannot be harmed by TL3 or lower weapons. Only one plating fitting can be installed on a suit at once.
### Plating, Basic
Grants the user AC 18, Soak 20, +1 Trauma Target, and immunity to Shock. They cannot be harmed by TL3 or lower weapons. Only one plating fitting can be installed on a suit at once.
### Plating, Improvised
Grants the user AC 16, Soak 15, and +1 Trauma Target. They cannot be harmed by TL2 or lower weapons. Only one plating fitting can be installed on a suit at once.
### Plating Pretech
Grants the user AC 22, Soak 30, +2 Trauma Target, and they can only be Trauma’d by weapons that could inflict Trauma on a vehicle. They are immune to Shock and TL3 or lower weapons. Only one plating fitting can be installed on a suit at once.
### QECM Projector
As an ECM Projector fitting, but it has a 500 meter radius and affects TL4 comms and any non-line-of-sight remote control. Nuclear detonations or other dangerous fission reactions fizzle harmlessly within this area.
### Reactive Antipersonnel Armor
As a Main Action, trigger surface-mount shrapnel bursters to inflict 3d8 damage on all subjects within 5 meters of you, with an Evasion save for half. Reloading it requires five minutes and a handful of easily-acquired metal scrap.
### Regenerative Force Field
The suit projects a skin-tight defensive force shield that keeps out dangerous energies and high-speed physical threats. The suit’s Soak score is increased by 10 points.
### Ricochet Field
A limited-range grav redirection field can be triggered as a Main Action, forming a translucent 2x2 meter shield in front of the user that moves with them. Any physical bullets, shrapnel, or other material projectiles aimed at them from the front force a Dex/Shoot skill check at difficulty 9; on a failure, the bullet is deflected; non-directed projectiles such as grenade shrapnel are automatically redirected. Maintaining the field requires a Move action each round, and when dropped, the field cannot be triggered again for a half-hour.
### Sealed Systems, Advanced
The user is immune to toxic gases, and the suit shielding nullifies any level of radiation that wouldn’t instantly kill a person. The suit provides oxygen and thermal protection adequate for deep space or underwater operation for as long as the suit’s power lasts.
### Sealed Systems, Basic
Dangerous gases and radiation of an intensity less than one save per minute are both filtered by the suit, though it doesn’t provide its own oxygen.
### Short-Range Warp Capacitor
As an On Turn action, the user can teleport up to 30 meters to a visible location, along with anything they are carrying. Each time this fitting is used after the first in a scene, roll 1d6; on a 3 or less, it fails and will not function for the rest of the scene.
### Skysweeper Laser System
A back-mounted anti-air laser system is programmed to torch incoming hostile objects. Once per round, the laser automatically melts or disables the first grenade, artillery shell, mortar round, or other large ballistic missile that would hit the user or include them in its blast radius. The munition might explode, but it will do so too far away to harm the user. The laser can’t effectively target powered drones or other flying objects that do not obey simple ballistics.
### Smokethrower
As an On Turn action, trigger surface-mounted smoke projectors to create a 5-meter-radius cloud around the user. Helmet optics allow clear sight through this specific smoke mix. Shrouded creatures cannot be targeted by ranged attacks and apply a -4 penalty to any melee attacks against them. The cloud persists for 1d6+1 rounds, and can be used only once per scene.
### Storm Reinforcement
Multiple ablative units and grav buffers minimize the damage of glancing projectiles. The user can ignore Suppressive Fire, though they can be targeted directly as usual.
### Stun Skin
An electrical mesh on the surface of the fitting will shock anyone who grapples or makes an unarmed attack against the user, inflicting 2d6 non-lethal electrical damage after each successful unarmed hit or each round of grappling.
### Target Lock Processor
As a Move action, the user can nominate a target within visible range. They gain a +4 bonus to hit that target while the lock is maintained. It can be ended as an On Turn action; only one target can be locked at a time.
### Thermal Ablative Layer
Advanced cooling systems cut all incoming fire damage in half before defenses are applied, and negate smoke inhalation dangers or any fire damage source of 10 HP or less. Plasma and laser weapons are not affected by this fitting.
### Trauma Stabilizer Unit
Built-in medical systems automatically stabilize the user when they are reduced to zero hit points. This system will not trigger if the downing blow was a Traumatic Hit or some unsurvivable injury.
### Tsukumogami Processor
The suit is integrated with a companion virtual intelligence. While not a full-fledged True AI, the VI is by all measures as intelligent and flexible as a normal human being. Most are programmed to be helpful adjuncts to their suit’s user. The processor gets a bonus Main Action every round that can only be used to perform non-physical actions or trigger a suit system. For safety reasons, it cannot operate the suit’s weaponry or compel it to move. It has a +3 skill bonus for any skill checks related to suit operation or military matters.
### Wallcrawler Anchors
Micro-scale gravitic manipulators allow the user to climb sheer surfaces and overhangs provided they could bear an unarmored human’s weight. This movement is done at the user’s normal Move rate, but does require at least one hand free.
### Weapon Mount, Advanced
As a Basic Weapon Mount, but man-portable heavy weapons may also be integrated, and slugthrowers have four built-in magazines. The integration bonus is +3 to hit rolls and damage.
### Weapon Mount, Basic
A single one or two-handed non-heavy melee or ranged weapon can be integrated into or removed from this mount with a day’s work. Once installed, energy weapons have effectively unlimited ammo, and slugthrowers have two built-in magazines. Both of these built-in magazines can be reloaded as a single Main Action by the user. Integrated targeting systems give mounted weapons a +2 to hit and damage rolls, but not Shock. Weapon Mount fittings can be mounted more than once on a suit, Mass and Power permitting.
### Weapon Mount, Heavy
A single vehicle-mounted heavy weapon can be mounted on the suit. Energy weapons have effectively unlimited ammo, while slugthrowers or missile launchers have three full magazines built in, which can all be reloaded as a single Main Action. Weapons that normally require a bipod or prepared firing position can be mounted. The weapon must be small enough to plausibly be mounted on a technical or small truck. Integrated firing calculators grant the weapon a +3 bonus to hit.
### Weasel Probe
A ferret-sized probe unit is connected to the suit by a fiber-optic control cable. The user can move it at up to 20 meters per round as a Move action, out to a 200-meter maximum range. The probe relays sound and vision to the user, has a built-in voice transmitter for the user’s speech, and has optics that can see in the dark. The unit has a +2 skill bonus for Stealth check purposes and can travel across any surface a ferret could. It has an AC of 15 and 4 hit points; it goes inert if the cable is cut. If destroyed, this fitting is useless until the next maintenance cycle.
