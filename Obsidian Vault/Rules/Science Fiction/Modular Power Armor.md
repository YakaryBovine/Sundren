Rare relics of a violent past, modular power armor remains a fearsome legend in most post-Scream regions. A single combatant in properly fitted modular armor is a match for a half-dozen less fortunate fighters, even if this prowess comes at a dire cost in energy cells and maintenance labor.

The first usage of modular power armor took place among the corporate states, toward the end of their era. These early suits often relied heavily on the cybernetic implants of their wearers, and when cybernetics fell out of favor during the Ignition, researchers were required to go back to first principles to develop suits that could be worn by those without extensive augmentations.

The expense of building these suits militated against over-specialization, and so the designers focused on developing a basic framework that could accept swappable specialized components to handle any mission. While never terribly popular on the frontier worlds, which could seldom muster the technical resources to maintain the suits, numerous core worlds and Old Terra itself were well stocked with these suits.

Amid the chaos of the Scream, most modular armor was destroyed in the fighting or cannibalized to keep other suits running as long as possible. In the centuries since, these suits have become seldom-found treasures for enterprising scavengers or ambitious raider lords. Even those who find an operable suit are hard pressed to keep it running, but for as long as these artifacts keep working their fearsome power is a weapon in their wielder’s hand.
## Frames and fittings
Modular armor is built around a base [[Modular Armor Frames|frame]]. This frame is skeletal in nature, cannot be worn over other armor, and provides no particular benefits to the wearer. Only after specialized modular armor [[Modular Armor Fittings|fittings]] are added to it does it grant any special advantages.

Each modular fitting is a relatively compact bundle weighing 2 [[Encumbrance]]. Anyone with a toolkit and Fix-0 [[Skills|skill]] can attach or detach a fitting from a suit with half an hour’s work per fitting.

Each fitting has a cost in Mass and a cost in Power. The total Mass and Power of all fittings cannot exceed the rating of the frame, or none of the fittings will work.
## Modular armor soak
Almost all armor frames have a Plating [[Modular Armor Fittings|fitting]] installed to provide armor and protection to the wearer. These fittings grant a certain number of Soak points. Damage done to the user is removed from their Soak first, and only after the Soak is completely depleted does the damage go through to the wearer. Soak refreshes at the end of every scene.
## Modular armor training
Operating modular armor is a much more complex process than simply strapping it on. Learning how to handle objects without accidentally crushing them or how to calibrate a suit to a specific user’s physical dimensions takes time and practice. It’s possible that some ex-military PCs may already have this training as part of their background, but others need to spend time with the suit to learn how to use it correctly.

If a student has a trainer familiar with modular armor use, it takes five hours of time in the suit to pick up the necessary basics. Without a trainer, it takes ten hours. This practice time can be expected to eat a lot of Type B power cells if the suit’s not equipped with a good *Efficiency Core* [[Modular Armor Fittings|fitting]].

An untrained user is constantly fighting the suit. Any [[Attacking#Attack Rolls|attack rolls]], [[Saving Throws|saving throws]], or [[Skill Checks|skill checks]] they make are rolled twice, and the worst roll is used.
## Wearing and transporting armor
Most modular armor suits are designed for quick use, and may be donned or removed as a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Main Action]]. Suits do not normally have “keys” or other security measures that would risk leaving them inaccessible in a crisis; their security against theft is supposed to be a large number of soldiers surrounding them at all times.

Even the lightest modular armor suit is heavy, usually weighing fifty kilos or more. A team of two porters can carry a suit between them, but the burden will consume all their Stowed Encumbrance. Three suits will usually fit in the back of a civilian pickup truck. For larger cargo vehicles or spaceship holds, the bulk of the suit counts as one ton of cargo.
## Powering modular armor
If lacking any *Efficiency Core* [[Modular Armor Fittings|fittings]], a standard suit of powered armor runs for 30 minutes on a single Type B power cell. The extreme power demands of the suit are destructive to energy cells, and any cell used to power a suit is destroyed. Swapping in a new cell safely takes ten minutes; an emergency hot swap can be made as a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Main Action]], but requires a Dex/Fix [[Skill Checks|skill check]] against difficulty 9. On a failure, the suit is incapacitated until its next maintenance cycle.

A user trapped in a depowered suit can blow the emergency releases as a Main Action to escape it. A depowered suit grants no benefits to the wearer except its armor class and Soak rating. It is generally impossible to fight or move in a depowered suit.

A wearer can turn their suit’s power on or off as an [[Action Types#On Turn action|on turn action]]. This is done occasionally when the user is wearing the suit while being transported to an operation zone.
## Maintaining modular armor
Modular armor needs extensive maintenance by a skilled technician to keep it functioning properly. Despite the extremely advanced pre-tech science available to the Mandate, it was thought most prudent to leave these maintenance requirements in place to limit the dangers of a wayward suit being hijacked by rebels or malcontents.

A suit needs a half-hour of maintenance after every full power cycle of use. Thus, if a suit with an *Advanced Efficiency Core* can operate for eight hours on a Type B cell, it would need a half-hour of maintenance after eight hours of use.

A suit maintainer needs Fix-1 [[Skills|skill]], or Fix-2 if any pre-tech [[Modular Armor Fittings|fittings]] are installed in the suit, along with a toolkit of the same tech level as the most sophisticated fitting to be maintained. One unit of scrap is also needed, of the same tech level as the most advanced fitting on the suit, or one TL3 unit if no fittings are installed. If playing in a sci-fi *Stars Without Number* setting where spare parts are usually purchased, it costs 1,000 credits to maintain a TL3-only suit, 5,000 for a suit with TL4 fittings, or 10,000 for a suit with TL5 fittings.

The first time maintenance is skipped for a suit, a 1d6 is rolled each scene before any given suit fitting is used or grants its benefit; on a 1, the fitting fails to function and won’t until the suit is maintained. Each additional skipped maintenance interval increases the odds of failure by 1, for a 2-in-6 after the second interval, a 3-in-6 after the third, and so forth. Maintaining the suit clears all backlogs.
## Damaging modular armor
If a suit user is [[Injury, Healing, and System Strain|Mortally Wounded]], the suit is inoperable until after its next maintenance. If a user is killed in the suit, each [[Modular Armor Fittings|fitting]] rolls a Luck [[Saving Throws|save]] with the wearer’s saving throw; on a failure, the fitting is wrecked beyond repair. The suit’s frame will always be salvageable barring truly spectacular violence.

If playing with the hacking rules described in *Cities Without Number*, add the “Modular Armor Fitting” Noun type. Individual fittings can then be targeted with any Verbs that would affect cyberware, with the exception of Plating fittings, which cannot be hacked. The suit frame itself cannot be hacked.
## Building frames and fittings
A post-apocalyptic tech can’t be expected to have the sophisticated TL4 factory facilities necessary to build a modular armor [[Modular Armor Frames|frame]] from scrap. However, a tech with a TL4 toolkit or similar workshop can cannibalize three ruined armor frames into a single Scrap Frame with a month of work.

Building a [[Modular Armor Fittings|fitting]] requires the same cannibalization. Three fittings, broken or functional, can be broken down to build one new fitting of the tech’s choice provided it is of equal or lesser tech level than the simplest donor fitting. Such reworking takes one week of effort.

For sci-fi settings such as *Stars Without Number* where this powered armor could conceivably be purchased on the open market, prices in credits are given. This assumes a world where the authorities are actually fine with selling high-end military hardware to the public. Buying it on the black market could be multiples higher in cost, or simply unavailable at any price if the GM would prefer not to make it available in their campaign.
## Frame weapons and attacks
Users can attach several *Weapon Mount* [[Modular Armor Fittings|fittings]] to their frame. The user must supply the weapon to be mounted, but modded guns and other augmented weapons can be used. A frame pilot can also simply use carried weapons normally, though such implements don’t gain the to-hit bonus that a *Weapon Mount* fitting grants.

While a suit can have several weapons mounted at once, a user can still only shoot or slash with one of them for each [[Action Types#Main Actions|Main Action]] they take. Users who would prefer to have more lead in the air at once should refer to the *Linked Targeting System* fitting.
