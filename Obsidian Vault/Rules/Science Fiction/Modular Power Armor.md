Rare relics of a violent past, modular power armor re-mains a fearsome legend in most post-Scream regions. A single combatant in properly-fitted modular armor is a match for a half-dozen less fortunate fighters, even if this prowess comes at a dire cost in energy cells and maintenance labor.

The first usage of modular power armor took place among the corporate states, toward the end of their era. These early suits often relied heavily on the cybernetic implants of their wearers, and when cybernetics fell out of favor during the Ignition researchers were required to go back to first principles to develop suits that could be worn by those without extensive augmentations.

The expense of building these suits militated against overspecialization, and so the designers focused on developing a basic framework that could accept swappable specialized components to handle any mission. While never terribly popular on the frontier worlds, which could seldom muster the technical re-sources to maintain the suits, numerous core worlds and Old Terra itself were well-stocked with these suits.

Amid the chaos of the Scream, most modular ar-mor was destroyed in the fighting or cannibalized tokeep other suits running as long as possible. In thecenturies since, these suits have become seldom-foundtreasures for enterprising scavengers or ambitiousraider lords. Even those who find an operable suitare hard pressed to keep it running, but for as long asthese artifacts keep working their fearsome power isa weapon in their wielder’s hand.
## Frames and fittings
Modular armor is built around a base frame. Thisframe is skeletal in nature, cannot be worn over oth-er armor, and provides no particular benefits to thewearer. Only after specialized modular armor fittingsare added to it does it grant any special advantages.

Each modular fitting is a relatively compact bun-dle weighing 2 Encumbrance. Anyone with a toolkitand Fix-0 skill can attach or detach a fitting from a suitwith half an hour’s work per fitting.

Each fitting has a cost in Mass and a cost in Power.The total Mass and Power of all fittings cannot exceedthe rating of the frame, or none of the fittings willwork.
## Modular armor soak
Almost all armor frames have a Plating fitting installed to provide armor and protection to the wearer. These fittings grant a certain number of Soak points. Dam- age done to the user is removed from their Soak first, and only after the Soak is completely depleted does the damage go through to the wearer. Soak refreshes at the end of every scene.

## Modular armor training
Operating modular armor is a much more complexprocess than simply strapping it on. Learning how tohandle objects without accidentally crushing themor how to calibrate a suit to a specific user’s physicaldimensions takes time and practice. It’s possible thatsome ex-military PCs may already have this trainingas part of their background, but others need to spendtime with the suit to learn how to use it correctly.

If a student has a trainer familiar with modulararmor use, it takes five hours of time in the suit to pickup the necessary basics. Without a trainer, it takes tenhours. This practice time can be expected to eat a lotof Type B power cells if the suit’s not equipped with agood *Efficiency Core* fitting.

An untrained user is constantly fighting the suit.Any attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks theymake are rolled twice, and the worst roll is used.
## Wearing and transporting armor
Most modular armor suits are designed for quick use,and may be donned or removed as a Main Action. Suitsdo not normally have “keys” or other security mea-sures that would risk leaving them inaccessible in acrisis; their security against theft is supposed to be alarge number of soldiers surrounding them at all times.

Even the lightest modular armor suit is heavy,usually weighing fifty kilos or more. A team of twoporters can carry a suit between them, but the burdenwill consume all their Stowed Encumbrance. Threesuits will usually fit in the back of a civilian pickuptruck. For larger cargo vehicles or spaceship holds, thebulk of the suit counts as one ton of cargo.
## Powering modular armor
If lacking any Efficiency Core fittings, a standard suit ofpowered armor runs for 30 minutes on a single TypeB power cell. The extreme power demands of the suitare destructive to energy cells, and any cell used topower a suit is destroyed. Swapping in a new cell safelytakes ten minutes; an emergency hot swap can be madeas a Main Action, but requires a Dex/Fix skill checkagainst difficulty 9. On a failure, the suit is incapaci-tated until its next maintenance cycle.

A user trapped in a depowered suit can blow theemergency releases as a Main Action to escape it. A de-powered suit grants no benefits to the wearer except itsarmor class and Soak rating. It is generally impossibleto fight or move in a depowered suit.

A wearer can turn their suit’s power on or off asan On Turn action. This is done occasionally whenthe user is wearing the suit while being transportedto an operation zone.

## Maintaining modular armor
Modular armor needs extensive maintenance by askilled technician to keep it functioning properly. De-spite the extremely advanced pretech science availableto the Mandate, it was thought most prudent to leavethese maintenance requirements in place to limit thedangers of a wayward suit being hijacked by rebels ormalcontents.

A suit needs a half-hour of maintenance after ev-ery full power cycle of use. Thus, if a suit with an Ad-vanced Efficiency Core can operate for eight hours on aType B cell, it would need a half-hour of maintenanceafter eight hours of use.

A suit maintainer needs Fix-1 skill, or Fix-2 if anypretech fittings are installed in the suit, along with atoolkit of the same tech level as the most sophisticat-ed fitting to be maintained. One unit of scrap is alsoneeded, of the same tech level as the most advancedfitting on the suit, or one TL3 unit if no fittings areinstalled. If playing in a sci-fi Stars Without Number set-ting where spare parts are usually purchased, it costs1,000 credits to maintain a TL3-only suit, 5,000 for asuit with TL4 fittings, or 10,000 for a suit with TL5fittings.

The first time maintenance is skipped for a suit,a 1d6 is rolled each scene before any given suit fittingis used or grants its benefit; on a 1, the fitting fails tofunction and won’t until the suit is maintained. Eachadditional skipped maintenance interval increases theodds of failure by 1, for a 2-in-6 after the second inter-val, a 3-in-6 after the third, and so forth. Maintainingthe suit clears all backlogs.
## Damaging modular armor
If a suit user is Mortally Wounded, the suit is inop-erable until after its next maintenance. If a user iskilled in the suit, each fitting rolls a Luck save withthe wearer’s saving throw; on a failure, the fitting iswrecked beyond repair. The suit’s frame will always besalvageable barring truly spectacular violence.

If playing with the hacking rules described in Cit-ies Without Number, add the “Modular Armor Fitting”Noun type. Individual fittings can then be targetedwith any Verbs that would affect cyberware, with theexception of Plating fittings, which cannot be hacked.The suit frame itself cannot be hacked.
## Building frames and fittings
A post-apocalyptic tech can’t be expected to have thesophisticated TL4 factory facilities necessary to builda modular armor frame from scrap. However, a techwith a TL4 toolkit or similar workshop can canni-balize three ruined armor frames into a single ScrapFrame with a month of work.

Building a fitting requires the same cannibal-ization. Three fittings, broken or functional, can bebroken down to build one new fitting of the tech’schoice provided it is of equal or lesser tech level thanthe simplest donor fitting. Such reworking takes oneweek of effort.

For sci-fi settings such as Stars Without Numberwhere this powered armor could conceivably be pur-chased on the open market, prices in credits are given.This assumes a world where the authorities are ac-tually fine with selling high-end military hardwareto the public. Buying it on the black market could bemultiples higher in cost, or simply unavailable at anyprice if the GM would prefer not to make it availablein their campaign.
## Findings frames as loot
GMs who want to add frames and fittings as loot totheir ruin sites or Mutant Wasteland raider camps cansubstitute a fitting in place of an artifact when lootis generated. A frame exists in the site at whateverchance seems reasonable to you; a successful raiderband might have one or two scrap suits in use, alongwith their fittings, while a well-preserved militarybase might have several un-cannibalized suits left ina secure bunker. If functional modular armor is avail-able to a group, they can be expected to use it duringa clear crisis. If the wearer is killed, remember thatthere’s an excellent chance that most of the suit’s fit-tings will be wrecked in the process.
## Frame weapons and attacks
Users can attach several Weapon Mount fittings to theirframe. The user must supply the weapon to be mount-ed, but modded guns and other augmented weaponscan be used. A frame pilot can also simply use carriedweapons normally, though such implements don’t gainthe to-hit bonus that a Weapon Mount fitting grants.

While a suit can have several weapons mount-ed at once, a user can still only shoot or slash withone of them for each Main Action they take. Userswho would prefer to have more lead in the air at onceshould refer to the Linked Targeting System fitting.
