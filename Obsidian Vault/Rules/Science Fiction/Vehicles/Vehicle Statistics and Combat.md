Most modern TL4 worlds rely on electrically-powered gravitic vehicles. Whether in the ubiquitous gravcar, hovercycle, or high-altitude gravflyer, cleared roadways carry the traffic of countless worlds. On rougher worlds, the roads may not even be paved, instead relying on a gravitic vehicle’s high clearance to avoid holes and rough debris. 

Less sophisticated worlds are still reliant on internal-combustion engines. Many worlds have sufficient local resources to fabricate some kind of combustible fuel, but a few are so impoverished that they lack even this minimal resource. Such worlds must rely on muscle power for transport, either that of alien beasts or humble human porters.
## Vehicle Statistics and Combat
Vehicles are generally powered by type B power cells on TL4 worlds. More primitive planets are usually forced to use some form of biofuel unless they’re fortunate enough to have a supply of fossil fuels. Vehicles require one cell or one refueling per six hours of operation, assuming they don’t have convenient power access. 

Vehicles are generally limited to reasonably flat, dry terrain. Grav vehicles such as hovercycles can ignore rough terrain and calm water, as can ATV explorers. Most grav vehicles can boost more than 10 meters above the ground or water; gravflyers are purpose-designed aircraft capable of hovering and VTOL.
### Speed
Speed is an abstract measure of the vehicle’s speed and agility. When vehicles chase each other, the opposing vehicle’s Speed should be applied as a penalty to Pilot [[Skill Checks|skill checks]] to close or escape. Speed may also be used as a modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or trying to avoid a peril on the road.
### Armor
Armor is subtracted from all weapon damage done to the vehicle. Armor does not apply to damage done by Heavy weaponry; such guns are often designed to take out vehicles. Gravtanks in particular are immune to anything short of TL4 Heavy weapons, while less sophisticated tanks are immune to anything below TL3 Heavy ordnance. 

Actually hitting the vehicle is automatic if the vehicle is stationary and within 30 feet. Hitting a vehicle-sized target from beyond that range requires an attack against AC 10. If the target is moving, subtract its Speed from the hit roll, and if the attacker is in a moving vehicle as well, also subtract their Speed. 
### Hit points
Hit Points indicate the amount of damage a vehicle can take before it is destroyed. Speed is reduced by half when the vehicle is at half hit points, and flying vehicles must land at the first opportunity. A vehicle reduced to zero hit points forces all crew and passengers to make Physical saving throws. Failure means that the passenger takes the vehicle’s maximum hit points in damage, while success reduces the damage by half. 
### Crew
Crew gives the maximum number of vehicle occupants. For the listed vehicles, only one crew member is actually necessary to drive or pilot the vehicle, though additional crew members may be required to fire. Tonnage is the shipping weight of the vehicle for ship loading purposes. Tech Level indicates the minimum tech level for constructing the vehicle. Vehicles can be built at higher tech levels for better performance, but most worlds prefer to simply build more advanced vehicles.

## Vehicle Weaponry
Most vehicles larger than a motorcycle or hovercycle can mount some kind of integral weapon. Groundcars and gravcars can mount one weapon, while ATVs, helicopters, atmoflyers, and gravflyers can mount two. Gravtanks are specialized weapons platforms, and can mount six. 

Heavy weapons take up more space than ordinary ranged weapons, and each such system takes up the space of two lesser guns. 

Every weapon requires its own gunner, and all mounted weapons use Shoot as the firing skill, though the GM might allow Pilot to be used for a nose-mounted weapon aimed by the operator. Gravtanks are equipped with advanced targeting systems, and all of their weapons can be targeted and fired by one gunner.
