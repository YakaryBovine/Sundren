Every world has its own brands of common vehicles, but the types below cover the more usual models. The prices given for each reflect a mid-range new vehicle sold to a PC with few local contacts. Natives who know the right people or are willing to buy used or “quirky” vehicles might be able to get one at half that price.

**Motorcycles** can navigate urban terrain that would block larger vehicles, but more rural landscapes can prove more difficult. Hovercycles are the TL4 equivalent, capable of brief boosts of up to 10 meters above the ground and the easy navigation of all but thick forests or sheer slopes. 

**Groundcars** are the TL3 analogs of the vehicles commonly in use on 21st-century Earth, allowing for some minor variations in electronics and capabilities. Primitive buggies of various kinds are found even on higher-tech worlds, thanks to their ease of construction and maintenance compared to the delicate gravitics of more modern vehicles. 

**Gravcars** are the standard personal vehicles of most TL4 worlds, though most lower-class citizens rely on public transport in urban areas. Most advanced worlds have planetary transit grids that allow occupants to simply code in a destination and let the car take them there. On worlds where a lack of infrastructure or hostile local conditions preclude such convenience, manual controls and Pilot [[Skills|skill]] can be used. 

**ATV Explorers** are rugged vehicles, either wheeled or tracked, and driven by type B power cells or locally-available biofuels. While they can’t navigate rough terrain as easily as a grav vehicle, they’re designed to take a tremendous amount of punishment before breaking down and support repairs using basic tools and frontier expedients. 

**Helicopters** are used on TL3 worlds where a lack of airfields or treacherous local terrain prohibits the use of fixed-wing craft. Their ability to hover over an area or drop onto a tightly-constrained landing zone makes them particular favorites of quick-response military forces and groups in need of fast fire support. This model represents a medium-weight civilian craft that might be repurposed by militia or adventurers. 

**Atmoflyers** are the fixed-wing aircraft used on planets too primitive to have developed gravitic technology. Faster and simpler to maintain than comparable helicopters, they can also carry more cargo on most worlds. The need for clear, hard terrain for landing and take-off limit their use on some rugged worlds. The model here is meant to represent a small personal jet. 

**Gravflyers** are the usual long-distance transport on most TL4 worlds. Large enough to support the gravitics required for true flight, a few models can even reach low orbit. All can hover and climb with typical gravitic ease. This particular gravflyer is a small craft suitable for a affluent owner and their family. 

**Gravtanks** make up the bulk of a prosperous TL4 world’s armored forces. Private ownership is strictly forbidden on most worlds, but “export models” often can be acquired for transport offworld. Gravtanks have armor heavy enough to ignore all damage from conventional small arms, and can only be harmed by Heavy weapons or properly-placed demolitions charges.
