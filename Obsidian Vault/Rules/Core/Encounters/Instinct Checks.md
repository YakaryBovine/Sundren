Very few creatures are capable of engaging in desperate, life-or death struggles without losing some amount of their rationality. Terror, fury, excruciating pain, and situational blindness can sometimes make a combatant do something genuinely stupid, even if they would never have made such a mistake in calmer circumstances The Instinct check is the game’s way of helping a GM take this situational chaos into account.
## Making an Instinct Check
Whenever an Instinct check is triggered, the GM rolls a 1d10. If the number rolled is equal or less than a combatant’s Instinct score, measured from 1 to 10, they do something impulsive, short-sighted, instinctual, or otherwise less-than-tactically-sound. Instinct checks are rolled separately for individual combatants, though the GM can simply decide that an appropriate percentage of large groups automatically fail the check. If the creatures have an Instinct of 3, for example, the GM might just decide that 30% of them fail the check rather than dicing for every one. 

PCs never make Instinct checks. Even in the grip of terror or traumatic injury they remain in control of their own choices. Heroically well-trained or tactically-expert enemies with an Instinct score of zero might likewise be immune to Instinct checks. Even martial paragons might be susceptible to Instinct, however, if they’re so proud, blasé, or contemptuous of their foes that they fail to fight them with their utmost cunning. 

When an Instinct check is failed, a creature will do something thoughtless or sub-optimal that is in line with their natural instincts. The adjacent tables offer example suggestions for various types of creatures, but a GM can simply decide the most reasonable reaction based on the situation and the combatants. A GM should use these instances as opportunities to show off the nature of an enemy or the instincts of a bestial foe, or to set up some battlefield situation that isn’t necessarily tactically-optimal for the enemy but is still troublesome for the heroes. Actions taken as a result of a failed Instinct check will usually only occupy one round worth of the creature’s efforts. 

Actions forced by an Instinct check failure won’t necessarily be entirely useless, but they won’t be the wisest or most effective use of the creature’s abilities. Blindly attacking sub-optimal targets, recklessly using unarmed attacks rather than the weapon in hand, or aiming spells or shots at targets of lesser importance might all be actions taken as a result of a failed Instinct check. 

Instinct checks are always optional and at the discretion of the GM. Some GMs might choose not to use them at all, judging actions strictly on what seems reasonable to them. In all cases it’s the GM’s final call as to whether or not to roll one.
## When to make an Instinct Check
As a general guide, a GM might make an Instinct check for a creature whenever any of the situations below are applicable, or any time the GM thinks the creature might be confused or indecisive.
- The second round of combat for mobs and undisciplined fighters. The creature could think clearly before starting the fray, but the fear and exhilaration of mortal combat might confuse it.
- The creature has just had to make a Morale check for any reason. Terror might cloud its thoughts.
- The enemy just did something confusing or disorienting. When the situation is strange, the creature might fall back on instinct.
- The enemy did something to enrage or directly intimidate it. Fury or terror might force bad decisions.
- The creature is presented with something it desires, such as dropped food, hurled money, or other inducements. It might go after the bait instead of the battle if it seems safe to do so.

Other situations might force Instinct checks as well at the GM’s discretion. Indeed, some situations might be so compelling as to cause automatic check failure. Depending on the situation, the GM might decide a particular response is the only reasonable one, and not bother to randomly pick it from a table.
## Assigning Instinct scores
For non-sentient beasts, a creature’s Instinct score should usually be about 5. Such beasts act largely by instinct in a fight- often very violent instincts. 

For non-combatant sentients and those unfamiliar with battle, Instinct should be 5 to 7. They are extremely likely to become conffused or useless. 

Ordinary intelligent veterans should have an Instinct of 3 or 4. They might get caught up in the confusion of battle and make some poor calls, but they’re unlikely to lose their head entirely.

Hardened, battle-tested fighters might have an Instinct of only 1 or 2, being very unlikely to forget themselves in the chaos of battle. 

The coldest, calmest killers would have an Instinct of 1, and may not have to make Instinct checks at all outside of the most disorienting situations. They’ll fight according to the plan and won’t lose track of the battle.

## Example instinctive actions
The tables here offer some suggestions for different types of actions that different kinds of foes could take. While the actions may be sub-optimal, assume that every creature will carry them out as intelligently as they are able to. A GM should also feel perfectly free to simply decide on a creature’s action, picking whatever course seems most likely for something of its motives and mentality.
