Characters accumulate experience points through successful adventure completion or other activities appropriate to the campaign’s focus. By default, PCs gain three experience points for an average successful mission. When enough experience points have been accumulated, they advance an experience level. New characters begin at first level and can rise to a maximum of tenth.
## Experience Point Requirements
The requirements listed below indicate the amount of experience needed to reach each level. Experience points do not reset on leveling up; the totals listed are total points accumulated.

| Level | Experience |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 1     | 0          |
| 2     | 3          |
| 3     | 6          |
| 4     | 12         |
| 5     | 18         |
| 6     | 27         |
| 7     | 39         |
| 8     | 54         |
| 9     | 72         |
| 10    | 93         |
## Advancement Benefits
Whenever a character advances a level, they obtain certain benefits.
### Additional Hit Points
To determine their new maximum hit points, they roll their hit die for each level they now possess, adding their Constitution [[Attributes#Attribute Modifiers|modifier]] to each die, and a further +2 if they have the [[Die Hard]] [[Focus|Foci]]. No individual die can be reduced below 1 point, even with a Constitution penalty. If the total roll is greater than their current maximum hit points, they take the roll. If less or equal, their maximum hit points increase by one.
### Improved Saving Throw
Their [[Saving Throws|saving throw]] scores decrease by one, making it easier to succeed on saving throws by rolling equal or over it. As a first level character has saving throw scores of 15, reaching second level would lower them to 14, modified by their appropriate attributes.
### Improved Attack Bonus
A PC’s base attack bonus improves according to their level and their chosen class.
### Gaining and Spending Skill Points
A PC who advances a level gains three skill points they can spend on improving their [[Skills|skills]] or save to spend later. [[Expert|Experts]] and [[Adventurer|Partial]] Experts with the [[Expert#Class Ability Quick Learner|Quick Learner]] class ability gain an extra bonus skill point to spend, giving them four points each time they advance.

Skills that are gained or improved immediately on gaining a level are assumed to have been perfected over the past level and require no training time or teaching. If they save their skill points to spend them later then they’ll need to find some teacher or other explanation for developing them in the meanwhile.

The cost for improving a skill is listed below. Every skill level must be purchased in order; to gain level-1 in a skill you need to pay one point for level-0 and then two points for level-1. A PC must be the requisite minimum level to increase a skill to certain levels. Less hardened adventurers simply don’t have the focus and real-life experience to attain such a pitch of mastery.

| Skill Level | Point Cost | Min. Character Level |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 0           | 1          | 1                    |
| 1           | 2          | 1                    |
| 2           | 3          | 3                    |
| 3           | 4          | 6                    |
| 4           | 5          | 9                    |

A PC cannot “partially buy” a skill level. If they don’t have enough skill points to buy a new level, they need to save them up until they can. A PC cannot develop skills beyond level-4.
### Improving Attributes
A PC may optionally choose to use their new skill points to improve their [[Attributes|attribute]] scores. 

The first time a PC improves an attribute, it costs 1 skill point and adds +1 to an attribute of their choice. The second improvement to their attributes costs 2 skill points, the third 3, and so forth. Each improvement adds +1 to the attribute, potentially improving its modifier. A PC can only ever make five such improvements total; not five per attribute. 

PCs must be third level before buying their third boost, sixth level before buying their fourth boost, and ninth level before buying their fifth boost. No more than five attribute boosts can ever be purchased by a PC.
### Choosing a New Focus
Finally, the PC might be eligible to pick an additional level in a [[Foci|Focus]]. At levels 2, 5, 7, and 10 a PC can add a level to an existing Focus or pick up the first level in a new Focus.

> The rules in the Worlds Without Number SRD mention gaining "bonus skills" from certain Foci. In my campaign, those Foci instead grant 2 skill points, which must be spent towards increasing the relevant skill/s if possible.

### Learning New Spells and Arts
[[Mage]] characters capable of spellcasting learn new spells when they advance a level. [[High Mage|High Mages]] and Full [[Invoker|Invokers]] learn two new High Magic spells they are capable of casting. All other spellcasting mages learn one spell they can cast, either from High Magic or their own specialist spells. 

Mages who use arts may also gain a new art pick, depending on their class. Each such class has a table that lists the schedule for gaining new arts.
