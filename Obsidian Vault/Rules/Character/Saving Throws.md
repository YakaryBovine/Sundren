Adventurers tend to face horrors of innumerable varieties, from the festering poison that smears some Deep-dwelling degenerate’s bone spear to the shadow of falling stones from above to the bite of some devil-wizard’s hideous sorcery. In order to avoid perishing to such dooms, they can attempt a Saving Throw. A saving throw is a chance a hero has to avoid some particularly grim outcome. 

To make a saving throw, the subject rolls a d20 and tries to roll equal or higher than the relevant saving throw score. There are four different kinds of saving throws. 

**Evasion saves** are made to dodge hurled perils, take cover from explosions, pull back from sudden pits, and face other challenges of nimbleness and reaction speed. Evasion saves for PCs are equal to sixteen minus the hero’s level and minus the best of their Intelligence or Dexterity [[Attributes#Attribute Modifiers|modifiers]]. Thus, a third-level hero with an Intelligence modifier of +1 and a Dexterity modifier of -1 would have an Evasion save of 12.

**Mental saves** are made to resist mind-affecting magic, disbelieve illusions, throw off intangible magical afflictions, and other tests of willpower or force of character. Mental saves for PCs are equal to sixteen minus the hero’s level and minus the best of their Wisdom or Charisma attribute modifiers. 

**Physical saves** are made to resist poisons, diseases, exhaustion, bodily transformation, or other taxes on the subject’s physical strength. Physical saves for PCs are equal to sixteen minus the hero’s level and minus the best of their Strength or Constitution modifiers.

**Luck saves** are for occasions of blind random for tune, where no quality of personal strength or cunning can help the hero. The GM might call for a Luck save when it really is nothing but sheer good luck that a hero might avoid some danger. Luck saves for a PC are equal to sixteen minus the hero’s level, unmodified by any attribute.

> [!NOTE] Last-ditch efforts
> Saving throws are meant to be last-ditch chances to avoid the worst of unusual perils or uncommon dangers. You can’t make an Evasion saving throw to dodge a sword stroke; that’s what the [[Attacking#Hit Rolls|hit roll]] is for. It’s up to the GM to decide whether a particular danger might allow a saving throw or not.
## Monsters and Saving Throws
Monsters, NPCs, and other creatures other than PCs don’t bother with four different saving throws. Instead, they just have a single save equal to 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down. Thus, a peasant with one hit die would have to roll 15 or better to make a saving throw against something, while a slavering hell-beast with 14 hit dice would only need to roll 8+ to succeed.

Some monsters might have particular bonuses against certain kinds of effects or perils, and the GM might decide to give some exceptional humans a boost based on their possession of unusual quickness or bodily fortitude.
