PCs who wish to wield two one-handed weapons at once may do so if they have at least Stab-1 [[Skills|skill]]. Doing so grants them a +2 bonus to [[Combat Attack Rolls#Damage Rolls|damage rolls]], albeit not to [[Shock Damage|Shock]]. They suffer a -1 penalty on [[Combat Attack Rolls#Hit Rolls|hit rolls]], however, due to the extra complication. Only one weapon may be used to attack in any given round, but either one may be used. Unarmed combatants cannot dual-wield.
