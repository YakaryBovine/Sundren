When a combatant wants to harm an enemy, they need to make a hit roll. An attack usually counts as a [[Actions in Combat#Main Actions|Main Action]] and the assailant must be close enough to actually hit the target with whatever weapon they have to hand.
### Hit Rolls
To make a hit roll, the attacker rolls a d20 and adds their relevant combat skill, their class attack bonus, and their relevant [[Attributes#Attribute Modifiers|attribute modifier]]. If they lack even level-0 skill in the weapon being used, they suffer a -2 penalty. Any other situational modifiers or penalties are also added to the roll.
### Damage Rolls
If the total is equal or greater than the target’s Armor Class, then the attack hits and damage is rolled. If less, then the attack misses. A missed melee attack may still inflict [[Shock Damage|Shock damage]] damage, if the weapon has a Shock rating and the target’s Armor Class is equal or lower than it. To roll damage, the attacker rolls the weapon’s listed Shock Damage damage die and adds their relevant attribute modifier and any bonus from a magical weapon, Focus, or other special benefit. 

The damage is then subtracted from the target’s hit points. If the target is reduced to zero hit points, it is either dead or mortally wounded. Generic NPCs with no name worth remembering are usually dead on the spot. PCs and NPCs significant enough to deserve characterization are instead Mortally Wounded. 

> [!tip] Hits in the Fiction
> A “hit” in combat doesn’t always mean a physical blow landed. Creatures or PCs with many hit points might take several “hits” before actually going down. In such a case, these successful hits are blows that exhaust the target, tax their luck, force them out of position, or otherwise bring them closer to losing. It may be that the only serious physical hit is the one that brings them down.

### Hit Roll Modifiers
The table below notes some common cumulative hit roll modifiers. GMs should use them as general guidelines when applying their own adjustments to hit rolls for circumstances not listed on the chart.

| Circumstance                               | Mod |
| ------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Shooting at a distant prone foe            | -2  |
| Shooting or meleeing an adjacent prone foe | +2  |
| Melee attacking while prone                | -4  |
| The target is at least half behind cover   | -2  |
| The target is almost completely in cover   | -4  |
| Thrown attack while being meleed by a foe  | -4  |
| Shooting a bow while being meleed by a foe | N/A |
Note that no penalty is given for shooting or throwing a weapon into a melee. It’s assumed that PCs have worked together enough to coordinate such attacks and avoid getting in each other’s way. A PC whose combat style is built around ranged attacks can easily end up frustrated by the rest of the party if they have to spend extra effort on special Foci or accept hit penalties simply because the rest of the group prefers to fight up close.
### Nonlethal Attacks
Some attacks may not be lethal in nature. If a non-lethal attack reduces a target to zero hit points, the attacker can choose to simply have their victim be unconscious or helpless, unable to act and reviving ten minutes later with one hit point. Attacks that are psychic or emotional in nature may reduce their victims to helpless shock or numbing confusion when they bring them to zero hit points, likewise incapacitating them for ten minutes. 

Unarmed attacks can always be non-lethal at the attacker’s discretion. Attacks with blunt and relatively forgiving weapons such as batons, staves, or clubs might also qualify, though it may take a Str/Stab or Dex/Stab [[Skill Checks|skill check]] against the target’s Morale score to see whether that last blow pacified them or accidentally knocked their brains out. In ambiguous cases, it’s the GM’s call as to whether damage is or isn’t non-lethal.
