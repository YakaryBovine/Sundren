When a combatant wants to harm an enemy, they need to make an attack roll. An attack usually counts as a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Main Action]] and the assailant must be close enough to actually hit the target with whatever [[Weapons|weapon]] they have to hand.
## Attack Rolls
When an assailant makes an attack, they roll 1d20 and add their base attack bonus, the weapon’s relevant [[Attributes|attribute]] modifier, and their relevant combat [[Skills|skill]] level. If they lack even level-0 in the appropriate combat skill, they apply a -2 penalty to the roll. If the total is equal or greater than the target’s relevant Melee or Ranged Armor Class, they hit. If less, they miss. 

Every weapon listed in the equipment section is listed as using one or more attributes, such as either Str or Dex for a dagger. The attacker may choose either attribute for modifying the weapon’s attack and damage rolls.

> [!tip] Hits in the Fiction
> A “hit” in combat doesn’t always mean a physical blow landed. Creatures or PCs with many hit points might take several “hits” before actually going down. In such a case, these successful hits are blows that exhaust the target, tax their luck, force them out of position, or otherwise bring them closer to losing. It may be that the only serious physical hit is the one that brings them down.
### NPC Attack Rolls
NPCs usually do not have attribute modifiers or skill levels. Instead, the attack bonus of a trained NPC combatant is usually equal to their hit dice, often with an additional bonus to reflect particularly good training or talent.
### Attack Roll Modifiers
Some common situations can modify an attack roll, granting a bonus or penalty. GMs may add others depending on the situation.

| Circumstance                               | Mod |
| ------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Shooting at a distant prone foe            | -2  |
| Shooting or meleeing an adjacent prone foe | +2  |
| Melee attacking while prone                | -4  |
| The target is at least half behind cover   | -2  |
| The target is almost completely in cover   | -4  |
| Thrown attack while being meleed by a foe  | -4  |
| Shooting a bow while being meleed by a foe | N/A |
## Damage Rolls
If an attack hits, it inflicts hit point damage equal to the weapon’s damage die plus the weapon’s relevant attribute modifier. Special weapon mods or abilities may increase this damage.
### Non-Lethal Damage
You may attack non-lethally with an appropriate weapon or unarmed attack. Your attacks will only incapacitate the target if you reduce them to zero hit points.
### Punch Weapon Damage
If you are making a purely unarmed attack you may add your Punch skill to the damage. You may not add the skill to the damage done by artificial weaponry that uses the Punch skill.
### Shock
Some melee weapons inflict Shock on a missed attack roll. This dam age reflects the inevitable harm a poorly-armored combatant suffers when engaging in armed combat. Shock for a weapon is recorded as a point value and target Armor Class, such as “Shock 2/15”. If the wielder misses a target with this weapon that has a Melee Armor Class equal or less than the weapon’s Shock rating, they suffer the listed amount of damage anyway. Thus, if that weapon were to miss a victim with Melee AC 13, it would still do 2 points of damage. 

Some attacks apply Shock on a miss regardless of the target’s Armor Class. This benefit may be granted by certain abilities, or it may be part of a dangerous NPC’s talents. Such Shock ratings are recorded with “-” as the affected AC, such as “Shock 5/-”. This automatic Shock is still negated by shields or abilities that grant a subject immunity to Shock. 

The only modifiers that add to Shock damage are the wielder’s relevant attribute modifier for the weapon and any damage bonuses that explicitly add to Shock. Thus, the Killing Blow class ability adds to Shock because it specifically says so, while a weapon mod that merely says it adds +2 damage would not.

A person using a shield can ignore the first source of Shock they would normally suffer in a round. Some other Foci or special actions such as Total Defense can also render a subject immune to Shock. 

An attack that hits can never do less damage than the Shock that would have been inflicted on a miss. If using the Trauma rules, dam age inflicted by Shock cannot cause a Traumatic Hit.
