There are certain special maneuvers or activities that commonly arise in combat.
## Shoving and Grappling
To shove a target or force them back, the attacker must first [[Attacking#Hit Rolls|hit]] the target normally for no damage and then succeed in an [[Skill Checks#Opposed Skill Checks|opposed Str/Punch or Str/Exert skill check]]. If the attacker succeeds in the skill check, the target is forced back up to ten feet or knocked prone. 

To grapple a foe, the attacker must first hit with an unarmed attack, doing no damage, and then both must make opposed Str/Punch skill checks. If the attacker wins, the defender is grappled and remains that way until released or until they spend a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Main Action]] and succeed in a new opposed check. An attacker can grapple only one target at a time, though multiple attackers can cling to the same luckless defender. In such cases, the defender’s single skill check is compared against all of their foes. 

While grappling, neither attackers or defenders can move from their current location, nor can they fight with anything but unarmed attacks. At the end of each round in which a defender remains grappled, they suffer damage from each attacker as if hit with an unarmed attack from each foe grappling them. 

If the attacker wishes to move the target, they must spend a Main Action and succeed in an opposed Str/Punch skill check. If they win, the target is either moved ten feet along with them, or thrown five feet and knocked prone. If they lose, the defender breaks free. 

These rules assume both targets are man-sized. Grappling or shoving significantly larger but still humanoid targets is done at a -2 penalty on all skill checks by the attacker. Doing so to creatures only barely plausible for such manhandling is done at a -4 skill check penalty.
## Dual Wielding Weapons
PCs who wish to wield two one-handed weapons at once may do so if they have at least Stab-1 [[Skills|skill]]. Doing so grants them a +2 bonus to [[Attacking#Damage Rolls|damage rolls]], albeit not to [[Shock Damage|Shock]]. They suffer a -1 penalty on [[Attacking#Hit Rolls|hit rolls]], however, due to the extra complication. Only one weapon may be used to attack in any given round, but either one may be used. Unarmed combatants cannot dual-wield.
## Execution Attacks
A target that is completely unaware of danger is vulnerable to a quick and bloody death, no matter how great their martial prowess or how thick their armor. An Execution Attack gives an assailant an opportunity to slay a foe with a single well-placed arrow or blade. 

Setting up such an attack requires a full minute of preparation. Archers, gunmen, and other ranged attackers must spend it judging distance, wind, and details of aim, while melee assassins must use it to drift up to the target and position themselves in the exact right place for the attack. Melee assassins must use a weapon for an Execution Attack, unless they have such special training as to make their unarmed attacks unusually lethal. If the target is spooked, the opportunity is lost.

Once the preparation is complete, the assailant may use a [[Action Types#Main Actions|Main Action]] to attack. The target’s Armor Class is irrelevant, assuming the attacker is using a weapon that can hurt the target. A melee Execution Attack will always hit. A ranged Execution Attack requires a Dex/Shoot [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]] against a difficulty of 6 for a point-blank shot, 8 for one at the weapon’s normal range, and 10 for a shot at extreme range. A [[Warrior]] can use their [[Warrior#Class Ability Veteran's Luck|Veteran's Luck]] ability with this skill check, but it only allows a reroll on a failed check rather than forcing an automatic hit. 

If the Execution Attack hits, the target must make an immediate Physical [[Saving Throws|saving throw]] at a penalty equal to the attacker’s combat skill level. If they fail, they are [[Injury, Healing, and System Strain#Mortal Wounds and Stabilizing|mortally wounded]] on the spot, or knocked unconscious if the attacker was using a plausibly non-lethal weapon. If they succeed, the weapon still does its maximum damage. 

Attacking an unconscious or incapacitated target will always leave them Mortally Wounded.
