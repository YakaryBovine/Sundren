The [[Action Types|actions]] below include some of the more common actions a participant might take during combat. The GM can make individual judgments about other types of activities that might be attempted.
### Melee Attack - Main Action
The combatant attacks an enemy within melee range with a Readied weapon, rolling a normal [[Attacking#Hit Rolls|hit roll]] and inflicting [[Attacking#Damage Rolls|damage]] on a successful hit. Most melee attacks inflict [[Shock Damage|Shock damage]] on a miss, if the target’s Armor Class is low enough, and no successful hit does less damage than the weapon’s Shock would have done on a miss.
### Ranged Attack - Main Action 
The combatant fires or throws a Readied ranged weapon at a target. The combatant can’t make a Ranged Attack with a two-handed weapon such as a bow if there’s a enemy armed with a melee weapon within melee range; it’s too easy for the assailant to hinder the use of a bow. One-handed ranged weapons and thrown weapons can still be used, albeit at a -4 penalty to hit.
### Snap Attack - Instant Action
A combatant with a Ready weapon can rush their attack, sacrificing accuracy for speed. The combatant must still have their Main Action impending or available. As an Instant, they can sacrifice it to make a melee or ranged attack against a foe, whether a snap shot with a bow or a quick thrust at an adjacent melee foe. This attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll. If multiple Snap Attacks go off at the same time, they are resolved simultaneously.

> Snap Attacks are normally only possible for PCs and other very well-trained or talented combatants. If an opponent isn’t significant enough to have been given a name, they probably shouldn’t be using Snap Attacks.
### Swarm Attack - Main Action
Each assailant takes this action against a target in range of their current weapon, until up to four have done so. When the final participant has taken this action, one of the mob can elect to make an immediate melee or ranged attack against their target, gaining a +2 bonus to hit and +1 to damage for each other surviving attacker, up to +6/+3. This damage bonus does not add to Shock and it cannot drive the attack’s damage over the maximum usually possible for the blow, but Shock from it always harms the target, even if they have a too-high AC, are using a shield, or have a Focus immunity to Shock. The sheer swarming numbers of foes are bound to inflict some kind of harm on the target provided they’re not completely immune to the mob’s weaponry.
## Cast a Spell - Main Action
An arcanely-gifted PC can cast a spell as a Main Action. If they’ve suffered any hit point damage this round, drawn or sheathed an item with their spellcasting hand, or have been severely jostled they cannot take this action. If they suffer hit point damage while casting, such as by someone who has held their action to attack at that mo ment, the spell fizzles uselessly and the spell slot is wasted.
### Charge - Special
A combatant can make a wild charge before hurling a weapon or crashing into a foe, moving up to twice their normal move in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack at +2 to hit. The charging attacker must be able to move at least 10 feet to get the requisite momentum and suffers a -2 AC penalty for the rest of the round. Charging takes both a Move and Main Action.
### Shatter a Shield - Main Action
To shatter a shield, the attacker must be using an axe, a mace, a Focus-improved unarmed attack, or some other crushing or hewing attack. The maneuver requires a successful hit roll and then an opposed Str/Stab skill check between the attacker and the defender, with the defender gaining a +1 bonus on their check. No damage is done, but if the attacker wins then the shield will be broken. Magical shields cannot be broken this way. Patching a damaged shield takes a scene’s work and Craft-0 skill.
### Screen an Ally - Move Action
The PC moves up to their normal Move rate towards an ally and then physically blocks opponents from attacking them, provided they remain within ten feet. Until the PC’s next turn, enemies who wish to make a melee or ranged attack against the screened ally must succeed in a successful [[Skill Checks#Opposed Skill Checks|Str or Dex-based opposed skill check]] against the PC using the combat skill applicable to their weapon; on a failure, the attack roll is automatically directed toward the screening PC.

A PC can screen against a number of attackers in one round equal to their combat skill; thus, Stab-2 lets them block the attacks of two different attackers. PCs with level-0 or worse combat skills can’t effectively screen. Multiple PCs can try to screen the same ally; in such a case, the attacker’s skill check is compared against all blockers and the lowest-rolling successful blocker is at tacked. PCs can only screen against foes and attacks they could plausibly physically parry or block with a shield.
### Total Defense - Instant Action
As an Instant action, the combatant focuses on nothing other than avoiding knives, arrows, hurled crystalline spears, or other perils in the vicinity. Using Total Defense costs the user their Main Action for the round, and cannot be used if they’ve already employed their Main Action. They become immune to [[Shock Damage|Shock damage]] for the round, including from [[#Swarm Attack - Main Action|swarm attacks]], and gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class until their next turn.
### Run - Move Action
The combatant moves their normal combat movement rate, which is 30 feet for most humans. If they’re climbing a surface, swimming, or navigating extremely rough terrain, this movement rate is halved, and they might have to make an Exert [[Skill Checks|skill check]] to achieve even that. [[#Go Prone - On Turn Action|Prone]] characters crab along at half this rate.
### Make a Fighting Withdrawal - Main Action
The combatant disengages from any melee foes around them. They don’t actually move away, but they can now get away from their assailants without giving them a free melee attack. Usually, this means the combatant uses their Move action to get clear, because if they just stand there the enemies might choose to re-engage them.
### Use a Skill - Main Action
The combatant uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds. An Int/Heal or Dex/Heal [[Skill Checks|skill check]] to stabilize a wounded comrade is one such potential use, as is turning a creaking engine wheel, shouting out a stirring rallying cry to timorous NPC allies, or anything else that might be done quickly.
### Ready or Stow an Item - Main Action
The combatant draws a weapon, extracts an item from their backpack, digs a potion out of a belt pouch, or otherwise moves an object around on their person. They can Ready an item this way or Stow it.
### Reload a Weapon - Main Action
The combatant reloads a weapon like a crossbow or an ancient projectile launcher with a Readied magazine or a quarrel from a Readied quiver. Bows can be reloaded as an On Turn action, assuming the archer has a Readied quiver and Shoot-1 [[Skills|skill]]; otherwise it’s a Move action.
### Drop an Item - Instant Action
The combatant drops something they’re holding. They can do this Instantly at any time to free up their hands.
### Pick up an Item - Move Action
The combatant can scoop an object off the floor if they have a free hand, leaving it Readied in their grip.
### Stand Up - Move Action
The combatant gets up from a prone position, gathering any dropped belongings. Most characters that have just been revived from unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.
### Go Prone - On Turn Action
The combatant falls flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a -2 penalty to hit them. Adjacent melee enemies find them an easier target, however, gaining +2 to hit.
### Hold An Action - Move Action
By choosing to Hold An Action, the combatant can delay taking the rest of their actions until later in the round, activating them as an Instant action. Thus, a hero who wins [[Initiative|initative]] might use their Move action to Hold An Action. Later in the round, as an enemy rushes around a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his Main Action to make a [[#Ranged Attack - Main Action|Ranged Attack]] with his readied crossbow. If acting in response to someone else’s impending action, the held action is resolved first.
### Delay An Action - On Turn
The combatant simply chooses to delay the remainder of their actions this turn until after a particular other participant has acted. Such a pause may be needed for some tactical plan or to respond to a particular enemy’s action. Unlike [[#Hold An Action - Move Action|Hold an Action]], however, they cannot suddenly choose to act earlier than their chosen place in the turn order; they must wait until the participant they chose has acted before using whatever remaining actions they may have for the turn.
