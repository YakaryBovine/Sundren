Some classes have special abilities that are fueled with magical power, inner focus, or some other reserve of energy. This capacity is measured in points of Effort, a resource the PC can commit to activate their abilities. 

Every class that uses Effort has its own unique pool: [[High Mage]] Effort, [[Vowed]] Effort, [[Healer]] Effort, and so forth. [[Adventurers|Adventurer]] with two Partial classes that use Effort have two separately-tracked pools, one for each class. Points of Effort from one class cannot be used to fuel powers from another. 

The maximum Effort of a Full class is equal to 1 plus a relevant [[Skills#Skill Levels|skill level]] and [[Attributes#Attribute Modifiers|ability modifier]] given by the class. A Partial class uses the same formula, but with 1 fewer point of Effort, to a minimum of 1.
## Committing Effort
Most class powers require that Effort be Committed. Committing Effort is done as part of activating a power, and ties up the Effort for a varying amount of time depending on the ability used. 

Some powers Commit Effort for the duration. This means the Effort remains Committed as long as the power is active. The PC can reclaim the Committed Effort at any time as an Instant action, deactivating the power. 

Some powers Commit Effort for the scene. The Effort remains Committed until the end of the scene, after which it returns to the PC. It cannot be reclaimed earlier, even if the ability it fuels is only good for a single attack or action. A scene usually amounts to a single fight, event, or dungeon turn, almost never lasting more than fifteen minutes. Further specifics are provided in the time section of the game rules. 

Some powers Commit Effort for the day. Once Committed, this Effort can be recovered only after a comfortable nightâ€™s rest. If the PC is hungry, cold, sick, or sleeping without the benefits of a bedroll or other basic comforts, this Effort cannot be recovered. 

Activating a power only ever requires Committing a single point of Effort, unless the power itself says otherwise.
