> This section only covers the *mechanics* for how to build a character in Worlds Without Number. See [[Backstory and Character]] to learn how to make a character backstory that will fit well in the game.
### 1. Choose Attributes
Each character starts has scores in Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You have 5 Attribute points to spend to build your Attributes. Increasing an Attribute costs points, while decreasing it gives points back, as per the table below.

| Attribute Value | Points |
| --------------- | ------ |
| 7               | +4     |
| 8               | +2     |
| 9               | +1     |
| 10              | 0      |
| 11              | 1      |
| 12              | 2      |
| 13              | 3      |
| 14              | 5      |
| 15              | 6      |
| 16              | 10     |
| 17              | 13     |
| 18              | 17     |
### 2. Record your Attribute Modifiers
Mark down your [[Attributes#Attribute Modifiers|Attribute Modifiers]] for each score. When rolling dice that are affected by an attribute, you don’t apply the whole score; instead, you apply the attribute modifier. A score of 3 is a -2, 4–7 is a -1, 8–13 is no modifier, 14–17 is +1, and 18 is +2.
### 3. Choose a Class
Choose your class from the Classes, representing those talents you have that are most relevant to an adventurer’s lifestyle. If your hero isn’t well-described by [[Warrior]], [[Expert]], or [[Mage]], you can choose [[Adventurer]] and mix classes.
### 4. Choose your Foci
Choose your [[Foci]], representing the side talents or particular specializations of your hero. You can pick one level of a Focus of your choice. Characters with the Expert class or the Partial Expert feature of the Adventurer class get one level of a non-combat Focus for free in addition to this. T hey can spend both levels on the same Focus, starting with level 2 in it if they wish. Characters with the Warrior class or Partial Warrior feature of the Adventurer class can do the same in choosing one level of a combat-related Focus.
### 5. (Optional) Choose your racial Foci
If you want to play a non-Human character, you can spend one of your Focus picks on the appropriate [[Origin Foci|Origin Focus]].
### 6. Choose your Skills
All characters start with at least 4 Skill Points. You gain an additional 3 for every skill-related Foci you picked. 

You can spend as many of these points as you like to increase any of your [[Skills]] from the starting value of -1 to either 0 or 1. A level-0 skill costs 1 point, while a level-1 skill costs 3 points.
### 7. (Conditional) Choose your starting spells
If you’re a full [[High Mage]], [[Elementalist]], or [[Necromancer]], or a [[Adventurer|Partial]] in two of these, choose four starting spells from your class’ first level spell list. Partial Mages of these classes pick only two. Re cord these on the back of your sheet.
### 8. Record your hit points
Roll your maximum hit points and add your [[Attributes|Constitution]] modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit point. The die you roll depends on the class you chose. [[Warrior|Warriors]] roll 1d6+2, [[Expert|Experts]] roll 1d6, and [[Mage|Mages]] roll 1d6-1. [[Adventurer|Adventurers]] use the tables on page 21, depending on which partial classes they took. If you lose all your hit points, your PC will be [[Injury, Healing, and System Strain|mortally wounded or slain outright]].
### 9. Record base attack bonus
Note down any base attack bonus you may have. This will vary based on your class; check your class article to see what your hero's basic martial aptitude might be.
### 10. Choose an equipment package
Choose an [[Equipment Packages|Equipment Package]] or roll 3d6 x 10 to find out how many starting silver pieces you have with which to buy gear.
### 11. Record weapon attack bonuses
Mark down your total attack bonus with your weaponry. This is equal to your base attack bonus, plus either your Punch, Stab, or Shoot [[Skills|skill]] depending on the kind of weapon it is, plus your relevant at tribute modifier. The [[Weapons|weapons]] article will tell you which attribute is used for a particular weapon. If two attributes are listed, use the best one for your hero. If you haven’t even got level-0 skill at combat, take a -2 penalty on the hit roll.
### 12. Record your weapon damages
Note down the damage done by your weapons. T his is equal to its base damage dice plus its attri bute modifier. If it’s a Punch weapon, you can add your Punch skill to the damage as well.
### 13. Record your Armor Class
Record your Armor Class, the measure of how hard it is to hurt your hero in a fight. The [[Armor]] article gives the score for a given harness. Different suits of armor grant different Armor Classes; if you aren’t wearing any armor at all, your base AC is 10. Add your Dexterity [[Attributes#Attribute Modifiers|modifier]] to this AC. In order to hurt your PC, an enemy has to roll an attack roll on a d20, adding their attacj bonus and equaling or exceeding your AC.
### 14. Record your Saving Throws
Note down your beginning [[Saving Throws|saving throw]] scores for your Physical, Evasion, Mental, and Luck saving throws. Physical saves 15 minus the best of your Strength or Constitution modifiers. Evasion saves are 15 minus the best of your Intelligence and Dexterity modifiers. Mental saves are 15 minus the best of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers. Your Luck saving throw is a flat score of 15. To make a save, you need to roll equal or better than it on a d20 roll.
### 15. Choose a name for yourself and goals for your party
Lastly, wrap up your PC with a name and a [[Backstory and Character|goal]]. Every hero needs to have a goal when they set out adventuring.
