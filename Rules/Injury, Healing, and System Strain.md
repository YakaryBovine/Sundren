## Mortal Wounds and Stabilizing
A creature reduced to zero hit points is dead or dying. Ordinary NPCs or unremarkable creatures will generally die on the spot. PCs and those NPCs important enough to have deserved a name will be Mortally Wounded. 

A Mortally Wounded creature is helpless, unable to do anything but scream, writhe, or lie unconscious. At the end of the sixth round after they were downed, they will die. They’ll die instantly if they take more damage. An ally can attempt to stabilize a Mortally Wounded companion. Doing so is generally an Int/Heal or Dex/ Heal [[Skill Checks|skill check]], one requiring a [[Actions in Combat#Main Actions|Main Action]]. 

The difficulty for this skill check is 8 plus the number of full rounds since the target was downed. If the healer lacks any useful medical implements, the difficulty for this skill check is increased by 2. Only one ally can try to stabilize a target in any given round, though others can attempt to aid their skill check, and a failed check can be re-attempted the next round.

Once stabilized, the target recovers with 1 hit point after ten minutes of rest, and can rise and act normally thereafter. They count as Frail, however, and will remain Frail until they have had at least a week of bed rest. Frail PCs cannot heal damage through natural healing and will die immediately if brought to zero hit points again. 

A physician can try to remove the Frail condition with an hour’s work and a skill check against difficulty 10. They only get one chance to remove a given Frailty.
## Natural Healing
A wounded creature recovers its level or hit dice in lost hit points after every night’s rest, assuming they’re properly fed and can get decent sleep. At this time they also lose one point of accumulated [[#System Strain]]. 

Creatures that are Frail do not recover hit points this way, nor do they lose System Strain.
## Magical Healing
Some healers have access to abilities that automatically heal hit points, such as a Healer’s arcane arts or the vitality-transmitting spells of a Necromancer. Other PCs might have elixirs of health, artifacts that cure injuries, or other sources of magical healing. 

A character healed by any amount of magical healing automatically loses any Mortally Wounded or Frail qualities and can immediately rise. A downed hero at zero hit points who gets 3 points of healing from a magic potion, for example, can immediately get up on their next turn and return to the fray without any frailty.
## First Aid
The powerful vitality of the people of the Sundered universe can be complemented by skilled medical attention and the use of numerous herbs, compounds, and other “mundane” techniques. While this can’t work miracles, it can prevent even significant injuries from slowing a victim too much. 

By spending a few minutes tending an ally, a healer can cure 1d6 plus their Heal [[Skills|skill]] in points of damage. They suffer a -1 on this roll if they have no Heal skill, perhaps doing no good at all. Each such application of first aid adds 1 [[#System Strain]] to the target, but it can be repeated for a wounded ally as often as the healer wishes and the subject’s System Strain allows. 

A single ten-minute turn or scene is usually sufficient to apply as much first aid as the party wants to apply. First aid can restore lost hit points to a Frail PC, but it cannot get rid of the Frail quality itself.
## System Strain
Most forms of healing and certain other magical powers add to a target’s System Strain. System Strain is a measure of how much stress the target’s body is under, and how profoundly it has been taxed by magical energies, hunger, privation, and forced healing acceleration. 

A character’s maximum System Strain is equal to their Constitution [[Attributes|attribute]]. Thus, someone with a Constitution of 13 could accumulate up to 13 points of System Strain. This strain is usually lost at a rate of one point for every night of good, refreshing sleep. 

Healing often adds to a target’s System Strain, whether as first aid or as the effect of some magical power. If the target is already at its maximum System Strain, it can’t handle the additional stress and gets no benefit from the effect or attempting healing.
## Poisons and Diseases
When a character is struck by some poison, they generally get a Physical [[Saving Throws|saving throw]] to avoid its effect, or at least mitigate its harm. Particularly powerful poisons might apply a penalty of up to -4 on this check, while weak toxins might grant a bonus of up to +4. The exact effect of a failed save depends on the poison. 

Diseases also generally allow a Physical saving throw, but are significantly slower in onset. If the first saving throw is a success, the target has avoided infection. If it’s a failure, the disease begins to take hold. The victim can make further saving throw attempts at weekly intervals, generally, with a certain number of successes sufficient to throw off the disease. Each failed save tends to make things worse, however, and fatal diseases can kill after three or four failed saves. 

Those with the Heal [[Skills|skill]] can tend the sick, granting a bonus to their saving throws equal to twice their Heal skill, or +1 in the case of a nurse with Heal-0 skill.
