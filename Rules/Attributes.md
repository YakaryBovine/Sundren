## Attributes
A character has six attributes ranging from 3 to 18, reflecting a range from the minimum viable capacity for a playable character to the maximum normal human level. 

Three of these attributes are physical. 
**Strength**, reflecting physical prowess, melee combat, carrying gear, and brute force. 
**Dexterity**, reflecting speed, evasion, manual dexterity, reaction time, and combat initiative. **Constitution**, reflecting hardiness, enduring injury, and tolerating large amounts of magical healing. 

Three are mental attributes. 
**Intelligence**, reflecting memory, reasoning, technical skills, and general education. 
**Wisdom**, reflecting noticing things, making judgments, reading situations, and intuition. 
**Charisma**, reflecting commanding, charming, attracting attention, and being taken seriously. 

NPCs do not normally have attributes. If necessary, the GM can choose them as appropriate, but usually they are assumed to have average scores if it’s ever relevant.
### Attribute Modifiers
Each attribute has a modifier, usually ranging from -2 to +2. This modifier is added to [[Skill Checks]], attack rolls, damage rolls, Shock damage, and the relevant saving throw targets. 

An attribute score of 3 has a modifier of -2. A score of 4-7 has a modifier of -1. A score of 8-13 has a modifier of +0. A score of 14-17 has a modifier of +1. A score of 18 has a modifier of +2. 

Some Foci and abilities may add bonuses or penalties to an at tribute’s base modifier. Such bonuses or penalties cannot increase the modifier above +2 or below -2 unless explicitly indicated. Some injuries or character advancements may alter an attribute score; this new score may change the attribute’s modifier.
